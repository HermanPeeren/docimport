<h3>PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 or 7.0 is required</h3>
<p>
    This version requires PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 or 5.6. The rationale behind this is
    explained in our
    <a href="https://www.akeebabackup.com/home/news/55-general/1501-end-of-php52-support.html">
        statement of mid-February 2013</a>. It won't install on hosts running PHP
    5.2 or earlier. PHP 5.3.4 or later is required, due to show-stopper bugs in
    earlier versions of PHP 5.3. Important note on reading PHP versions: PHP 5.3.20
    is newer than 5.3.10 which is newer than 5.3.4. Moreover, PHP 5.4.0 is newer than
    PHP 5.3.4.
</p>
<p>
    Use on PHP 7.0 is only supported on Joomla! 3.5. Earlier Joomla! versions do not run on PHP 7.
</p>

<h3>Joomla! 3.4 and 3.5 are supported</h3>
<p>
    This version of our software can be installed on Joomla! 3.4.x or 3.5.x. We always recommend that you should
    use the latest Joomla! 3 release available from Joomla.org.

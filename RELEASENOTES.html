<h3>Release highlights</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Workaround for CLI scripts</strong>. Joomla! 3.4.7 introduced a major bug which made it impossible for
    third party CLI scripts, used in CRON jobs, to complete successfully. Unfortunately it also affected the CLI scripts
    of our own software. This release applies a workaround which lets the CLI scripts execute without a problem.

<h3>PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 or 5.6 is required</h3>
<p>
    This version requires PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 or 5.6. The rationale behind this is
    explained in our
    <a href="https://www.akeebabackup.com/home/news/55-general/1501-end-of-php52-support.html">
        statement of mid-February 2013</a>. It won't install on hosts running PHP
    5.2 or earlier. PHP 5.3.4 or later is required, due to show-stopper bugs in
    earlier versions of PHP 5.3. Important note on reading PHP versions: PHP 5.3.20
    is newer than 5.3.10 which is newer than 5.3.4. Moreover, PHP 5.4.0 is newer than
    PHP 5.3.4.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the necessary Joomla! API changes
    found only in Joomla! 2.5.6 or later, this version will not install on Joomla!
    2.5.5 or earlier versions. In any case, if your server doesn't meet the minimum requirements
    it will tell you exactly why it cannot be installed (minimum PHP or Joomla! version not satisfied).
</p>

<h3>Joomla! 2.5, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 are supported</h3>
<p>
    This version of our software can be installed on Joomla! 2.5.6 or any later
    2.5.x release, as well as any 3.2.x, 3.3.x or 3.4.x release. It is not compatible
    with Joomla! 3.0 or 3.1. These versions of Joomla! are old and vulnerable.
    If you are using them please upgrade to the latest Joomla! 3 release available
    from Joomla.org.

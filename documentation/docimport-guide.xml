        <title>Introducing Akeeba DocImport</title>

        <para>Akeeba DocImport is a component which allows you to offer
        interactive on-line documentation from DocBook 5 XML source files. The
        idea is that you just need to upload your DocBook XML files and
        associated media files (e.g. images) in a subdirectory of the media
        directory and let the component convert them to HTML articles. The
        generated HTML articles are managed by DocImport itself.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Akeeba DocImport is a developer's product. It may be difficult
          for end users and site integrators to use. That's by design!
          Frankly, unless you are a hardcore developer, what are you doing
          messing around with DocBook XML? It's not like it is the easiest
          publishing format on this planet. If you are looking for something
          very easy to use to publish articles or structured FAQs on yoru site
          please look at one of the FAQ or CCK extensions for Joomla! at the
          Joomla! Extensions Directory.</para>

        <title>Installation</title>

        <section xml:id="installation">
          <title>Installation</title>

          <para>Installing the package is the same as with any other Joomla!
          component. Go to your site's back-end Extensions, Manage and click
          on Browse. Locate the ZIP package and click on Upload and Install.
          If the installation fails, please refer to the installation
          troubleshooting section of this guide.</para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="updating">
          <title>Updating to the latest release</title>

          <important>
            <para>This section may be very inaccurate while the component is
            in alpha</para>
          </important>

          <para>Akeeba DocImport can be updated with two different methods:
          installing the new version on top of the old one or using the
          integrated Live Update system.</para>

          <bridgehead>Updating directly</bridgehead>

          <para>This is the failsafe approach, but the least convenient.
          Download the latest Akeeba DocImport release from <link
          xlink:href="https://www.AkeebaBackup.com/latest">https://www.AkeebaBackup.com/latest</link>
          and save the ZIP file to your hard disk. Log in to your site's
          backend, click on <guimenuitem>Extensions Manager</guimenuitem>
          (Joomla! 1.6 and later). Use the <guibutton>Browse...</guibutton>
          button to locate the ZIP file you downloaded, then click on
          <guibutton>Upload and Install</guibutton>. All Joomla! versions
          since 1.5.5 are smart enough to understand that you're doing an
          upgrade instead of installation and adjust the process
          accordingly.</para>

          <important>
            <para>Do NOT uninstall Akeeba DocImport before updating it!
            Uninstalling will remove all of your data, including all of your
            XML source files!</para>
          </important>

          <bridgehead>Using Live Update</bridgehead>

          <para>Akeeba DocImport integrates our Live Update system. Log in to
          your site's backend and go to <guimenu>Components</guimenu>,
          <guimenuitem>Akeeba DocImport</guimenuitem>. Look towards the bottom
          of the page. There should be an icon which reads "Update found" when
          there is a new version available. Click on it and then click on
          "Update now". The new version will be downloaded and installed
          automatically for you. In case this doesn't work, or if "Live Update
          not supported" is displayed below the icon, please make sure that
          your host's firewall allows TCP/IP communications over port 80 and
          443 to <uri>akeebabackup.com</uri> and <uri>s3.amazonaws.com</uri>.
          If your host requests IP addresses instead of domain names, please
          ask them to trace them from the server as they are multicast
          hostnames, which means that they resolve to a different IP depending
          on where in the world you are.</para>

          <bridgehead>Something not working right after the
          update?</bridgehead>

          <para>Sometimes Joomla! "forgets" to copy all updated files. This is
          something that we have seen a few times. In this case, simply follow
          the instructions in the Updating Directly section above. This will
          force Joomla! to retry updating the component, copying the missing
          files and everything will work again.</para>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="uninstallation">
        <title>Uninstallation</title>

        <para>You can uninstall the component just like any other Joomla!
        component. In your site's back-end, just go to <guimenuitem>Extensions
        Manager</guimenuitem>, click on <guilabel>Uninstall</guilabel>, select
        Akeeba DocImport and click on <guibutton>Uninstall</guibutton>. This
        will completely remove Akeeba DocImport including all category and
        article information.</para>

      <title>Initial set-up and usage</title>

      <section xml:id="overview">
        <title>Overview</title>

        <para>DocImport is used to generate articles from categories. Each
        category either contains a single DocBook XML book or one or more
        DocBook XML articles.</para>

        <para>Each category has its own folder under the
        <filename>media/com_docimport</filename> directory. In the root of
        each category directory you place the XML file(s) of your DocBook XML
        book or articles. Images used in your book must be located under the
        <filename>images</filename> subdirectory. The intermediate results of
        the DocBook to HTML conversion will be located in the
        <filename>output</filename> subdirectory. If DocImport cannot create
        this directory it will not be able to generate the articles. In this
        case, please create this subdirectory manually and make sure that it
        is writable by Joomla!.</para>

        <para>Whenever you upload a new XML file or an updated version of an
        XML file to a category you need to rebuild the articles of that
        category. The rebuild process will convert your XML file(s) into HTML
        and then create or update articles. The rebuild process does not run
        automatically. You have to either launch it manually from the back-end
        of the component or run it periodically by means of a CRON job using
        the provided CLI script.</para>

        <note>
          <para>Uploading of new XML files and images is supposed to occur
          outside of the component, e.g by FTP or using Joomla!'s Media
          Manager. There is no facility to upload files from within the
          DocImport component.</para>
        </note>

        <para>DocImport is designed to create beautiful, sensible URLs without
        the use of a third party SEF component. It does so using its own
        router. Due to the complexity of the algorithm, building and parsing
        the URLs is a resource intensive process. In order to speed up the
        process DocImport uses its own SEF URL cache. If you get strange
        results after rebuilding a category you can always purge it so that
        DocImport can regenerate it.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="control-panel">
        <title>The Control Panel page</title>

        <para>The Control Panel page of the component is very spartan. You
        only have a handful of icons:</para>

          <varlistentry>

              experience wrong or no articles being displayed in some
              circumstances please click this button. It will empty the SEF
              URL cache of the component which is what most likely was causing
              the issue.</para>

      <section xml:id="categories-management">
        <title>Categories management</title>

        <para>This is the single most important page in DocImport. This is
        where you manage documentation categories and regenerate their
        contents (articles). It is a standard Joomla! grid view, with the
        following columns:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Up/Down Arrow</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>(Joomla! 3.0 and later) When you click on it you enable
              the drag &amp; drop reordering support. When the handle on this
              column is solid black you can drag it and reorder the
              categories.</para>

            <listitem>

            <term>Status</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>There are two icons here. The left one will tell you if
              the category is up to date. An X in an orange background means
              that the articles should be rebuilt. A tickbox in a green
              background means that the articles are up-to-date. DocImport
              determines that by comparing the date of your XML file(s)
              against the last date/time it built the articles for this
              category.</para>

              <para>The second one is a actually a button. When you click on
              it DocImport will (re)build the articles for this category off
              the XML source. You have to do that every time you create a new
              category or upload a new version of your XML
              documentation.</para>

              example, to have your documentation in English, French and
              German with only the properly localised version shown to
              visitors viewing your site in each language, i.e. English to

        <para>DocImport offers a command line (CLI) script which allows you to

        <important>
          <para>Some hosts offer "CRON jobs" which allow you to enter a URL
          which will be accessed periodically. This is NOT a CRON job. It is a
          "fake" CRON job and will not work with DocImport.</para>
        </important>

        <para>All <application>DocImport</application> releases include the
        file <filename>cli/docimport-update.php</filename>, which can be run
        from the command-line PHP interface (PHP CLI). It is a self-contained,
        native documentation rebuild tool for your
        <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> site, even if your web server is
        down!</para>

        <para>In order to schedule a documentation, you will have to use the
        following command line to your host's CRON interface:</para>

        <programlisting><replaceable>/usr/local/bin/php</replaceable> <replaceable>/home/USER/webroot</replaceable>/cli/docimport-update.php</programlisting>

        <para>where <replaceable>/usr/local/bin/php</replaceable> is the path
        to your PHP CLI executable and
        <replaceable>/home/USER/webroot</replaceable> is the absolute path to

              location of the correct executable file for cPanel 11 and later.
              Your host may use a different path to the executable. If the

      role="initialism">USA</abbrev> . Everyone is permitted to copy and
      distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
      not allowed.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">0. PREAMBLE</bridgehead>

      <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
      other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
      assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with
      or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
      Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
      to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
      modifications made by others.</para>

      <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
      works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
      complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
      designed for free software.</para>

      <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
      program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
      software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
      can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
      whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
      principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">1. APPLICABILITY AND
      DEFINITIONS</bridgehead>

      <para>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
      that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
      distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
      world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
      work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers
      to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and
      is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or
      distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
      law.</para>

      <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
      Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
      modifications and/or translated into another language.</para>

      <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
      section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
      the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
      subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
      directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part
      a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
      mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
      commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
      them.</para>

      <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
      titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
      notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a
      section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
      allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero
      Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
      Sections then there are none.</para>

      <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
      listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
      says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover
      Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
      words.</para>

      <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
      general public, that is suitable for revising the document
      straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
      pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
      drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
      automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
      markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format
      is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
      that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

      <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
      ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
      XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
      transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
      include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
      processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
      HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
      purposes only.</para>

      <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
      plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
      this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
      which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
      near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
      beginning of the body of the text.</para>

      <para>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
      whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
      following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
      for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
      "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of
      such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
      section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>

      <para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
      which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
      meaning of this License.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">2. VERBATIM COPYING</bridgehead>

      <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
      the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
      conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
      technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
      of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
      compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
      number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section
      3.</para>

      <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
      and you may publicly display copies.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</bridgehead>

      <para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
      have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
      Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
      copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
      Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
      cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
      publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
      with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
      to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
      satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.</para>

      <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
      pages.</para>

      <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
      numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
      Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
      Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
      network-using public has access to download using public-standard
      network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
      added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
      prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
      to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
      stated location until at least one year after the last time you
      distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
      of that edition to the public.</para>

      <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
      the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
      give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
      Document.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">4. MODIFICATIONS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
      under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
      release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
      Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
      distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
      possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
      Modified Version:</para>

      <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
        <listitem>
          <simpara>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title

          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
          section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous

          Section.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</simpara>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
      appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
      copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
      of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list
      of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These
      titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</para>

      <para>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
      contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
      parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
      been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
      standard.</para>

      <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
      and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
      list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
      Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
      arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a
      cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement
      made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
      another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from
      the previous publisher that added the old one.</para>

      <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
      License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
      assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released under
      this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
      versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
      Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
      list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
      notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</para>

      <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
      multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
      copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
      different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
      at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
      publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the
      same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
      in the license notice of the combined work.</para>

      <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
      "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
      Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
      "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must
      delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
      documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
      of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
      included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
      License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
      respects.</para>

      <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
      distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
      copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
      License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
      document.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT
      WORKS</bridgehead>

      <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
      separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
      storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
      copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal
      rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
      permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
      not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
      derivative works of the Document.</para>

      <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
      copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
      the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers
      that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
      equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
      they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
      aggregate.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">8. TRANSLATION</bridgehead>

      <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
      distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
      Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
      permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
      translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
      original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
      translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
      Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
      the original English version of this License and the original versions
      of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
      translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
      disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</para>

      <para>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
      "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
      Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
      title.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">9. TERMINATION</bridgehead>

      <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
      except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
      to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
      automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
      who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
      not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
      full compliance.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS
      LICENSE</bridgehead>

      <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
      the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
      will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
      detail to address new problems or concerns. See <link
      xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">
      http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</link> .</para>

      <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
      number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of
      this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option
      of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version
      or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
      Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
      number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
      as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your
      documents</bridgehead>

      <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy
      of the License in the document and put the following copyright and
      license notices just after the title page:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME.</para>

        <para>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
        document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
        Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software
        Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
        Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section
        entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
      Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
        LIST.</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
      combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
      situation.</para>

      <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
      recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
      software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
      their use in free software.</para>

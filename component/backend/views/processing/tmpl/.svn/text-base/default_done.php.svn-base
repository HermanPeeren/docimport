<h1>Operation complete</h1>
<p>DocImport just finished importing your documentation package.</p>
<p>If you had selected to create a new category, mind you that it is by
default unpublished. Also, newly added documentation articles are
unpublished as well. You may want to review them and eventually publish
them.</p>
<p>Thank you for using DocImport,<br />
the hacker's way to mass publishing Joomla! articles ;)</p>

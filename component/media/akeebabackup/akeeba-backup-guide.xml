      <title>Introduction</title>

      <section>
        <title>Introducing <application>Akeeba Backup</application></title>

        <para><application>Akeeba Backup</application> is a complete site
        backup solution for your <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> powered
        website. As the successor to the acclaimed
        <application>JoomlaPack</application> component, <application>Akeeba
        Backup</application> builds on its strong legacy to deliver an easy to
        use, yet powerful, solution to backing up, restoring and moving your
        site between servers of the same or different architecture.</para>

        <para>Its mission is simple: backup your entire site - including all
        files and database contents - inside a standalone archive. You can
        then restore your entire site from the contents of this archive,
        without the need of installing <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> prior to
        the restoration. You can do so in a single click manner, without the
        tedious work required to set up and test external utilities, without
        changing your server configuration and without having to dive into
        obscure configuration options.</para>

        <para>If you want absolute power and flexibility, <application>Akeeba
        Backup</application> is right for you, too! It puts you in charge of
        fine-tuning your backup, choosing which directories, files or database
        tables to exclude. It can even allow you to backup
        non-<trademark>Joomla!</trademark> content, as long as you specify
        which off-site directories and databases you want to add.</para>

        <para>Akeeba Backup has won the J.O.S.C.A.R. award in the
        Administrator Only Extension at J and Beyond 2010, in the Admin
        Extension category at J and Beyond 2011 and Component category in J
        and Beyond 2011. The award was the result of a peer voting process,
        where the high-end Joomla! developers and web designers participating
        in the J and Beyond conferences picked the top extensions for Joomla!.
        Akeeba Backup's lead developer shared the 2011 J.O.S.C.A.R. in the
        Code Junkie category with NinjaBoard's lead developer, Stian
        Didriksen.</para>

      <section xml:id="indicative-uses">
        <title>Indicative uses</title>

        <para><application>Akeeba Backup</application> can be used for much
        more than just backup. Some indicative uses are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Security backups</emphasis>. Taking a
            snapshot of your site should your server fail, or a hacker exploit
            some security hole to deface or compromise your site.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Template sites</emphasis>. Web
            professionals have used <application>Akeeba Backup</application>
            in order to create "template sites". This means that you can build
            a site on a local server, install every component you usually do
            on most clients' sites and back it up. You now have a canned site
            that can serve as a great template for future clients. Using the
            same method you can have a snapshot of all the sites you have
            built for your clients, without the need to have them installed on
            your local server.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Build a site off-line, upload the
            finished site easily</emphasis>. Web professionals can build a
            complete site off-line on a local server and when done take a
            snapshot with <application>Akeeba Backup</application>, then
            restore it on the production site.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Testing upgrades locally, without
            risking breaking the on-line site</emphasis>.
            <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> updates have the potential of
            breaking things, especially in complex or badly written components
            and modules. Web masters use <application>Akeeba
            Backup</application> to get a site snapshot, restore it on a local
            test server, perform the upgrade there and test for any problems
            without the live site being at risk.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Debugging locally</emphasis>. Almost
            the same as above, web professionals have used <application>Akeeba
            Backup</application> to take a snapshot of a client's
            <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> site in order to perform bug
            hunting. Using <application>Akeeba Backup</application> again,
            they can upload the fixed site back on the live server.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Relocating a site to a new
            host</emphasis>. Web masters who want to take their site to a new
            host have found <application>Akeeba Backup</application> to be
            their saviour. Just backup the original site and restore on the
            new host; presto, your site is relocated with virtually no effort
            at all.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        save you hours of hard labor, according to our users. It is licensed
        under the GNU General Public License version 3 or, at your option, any

      <section xml:id="a-typical-backup-restoration-workflow">
        <title>A typical backup/restoration workflow</title>

        <para>As stated, <application>Akeeba Backup</application> is designed
        to make your life easier. It does that by streamlining the workflow of
        backing up and restoring (or migrating) your site. From
        <application>Akeeba Backup</application>'s perspective, restoring to
        the same host and location, copying your site in a subdirectory /
        subdomain of the same host or transfering your site to a completely
        new host is identical. That's right, <application>Akeeba
        Backup</application> doesn't care if you are restoring, copying,
        cloning or migrating your site! The process is always the same, so you
        only have to learn it once. The learning curve is very smooth,
        too!</para>

        <para>The typical workflow involves using two utilities from the
        <application>Akeeba Backup</application> suite: the
        <application>Akeeba Backup</application> component itself, and
        <application>Akeeba Kickstart</application>. Here is the
        overview:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Install <application>Akeeba Backup</application> and
            configure it to taste. Or use the automated
            <guibutton>Configuration Wizard</guibutton> to automatically
            configure it with the perfect settings for your server. Hit on the
            <guibutton>Backup Now</guibutton> button and let your site back
            up. When it finishes up, click on the <guibutton>Administer Backup
            Files</guibutton> button. Click on the download links on the
            far-right of the only backup entry from the list - or, better yet,
            use FTP to do that - saving all parts of the backup archive
            somewhere on your local PC.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Extract the kickstart- <replaceable>VERSION</replaceable>
            .zip file you downloaded from our Downloads repository. The only
            contained files are <filename>kickstart.php</filename> and the
            translation INI files. Upload them to the server on which you want
            to restore your site to.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Upload all parts of the backup archive (do not extract it
            yet, just upload the files) to the server on which you want to
            restore your site to (called hereforth the <emphasis>target
            server</emphasis> ). Your server's directory should now contain
            the <filename>kickstart.php</filename> and the parts of the backup
            archive (.jpa, .j01, etc).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Fire up your browser and visit the Kickstart URL on your

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Change any option - if necessary - and hit the
            <guibutton>Start</guibutton> button. Sit back while Kickstart
            extracts the backup archive directly on the server! It's
            ultra-fast too (when compared to FTP uploading all those 4000+
            files!). If it fails with an error, go back, select the
            <option>Upload using FTP</option> option and supply your FTP
            connection information, then click on Start again.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A new window pops up. It's the <application>Akeeba Backup
            Installer</application> (<acronym>ABI</acronym>), the site
            restoration script which was embedded inside your archive. Do not
            close the Kickstart window yet!</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>When the <application>Akeeba Backup Installer</application>
            is done, it prompts you to delete the installation directory.

            window.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Back to the Kickstart window, click the button titled
            <guibutton>Clean Up</guibutton>. Kickstart removes the
            installation directory, restores your .htaccess file (if you had
            one in the first place), removes the backup archive and
            itself.</para>

        <para>If you are restoring to a different subdirectory on the same
        server as the original site, or to a whole different host, you might

          <para>Google Chrome 4 introduced a feature where it permanently
          "remembers" redirections. Since redirections are a key component to
          the internal working of <trademark>Joomla!</trademark>, using Google
          Chrome 4+ to administer your <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> site can
          lead to unexpected results, unless you are using Joomla! 1.5.17 or
          any later version. Therefore we <emphasis
          role="bold">strongly</emphasis> recommend upgrading your sites to
          the latest Joomla! release. Akeeba Backup does include workarounds
          for Chrome's behaviour, but we can't guarantee that anything else in
          Joomla! (including installation) will work smoothly.</para>
        </important>

        <para>In any case, you must make sure that Javascript is enabled on
        your browser for the backup to work. If you are using AVG antivirus,
        please disable its Link Checker feature as it is known to cause
        problems with several Javascript-based web applications, including
        Akeeba Backup and its tools.</para>

          Just click on the Download, Official Releases menu item on the top
          menu of our site. Then click on Akeeba Backup. The releases are
          listed with the newest release always on top. Click on it to view
          the files. If you are not a subscriber, click on the Akeeba Backup
          Core to download the ZIP installation package. If you are a
          subscriber to the Professional release (AKEEBAPRO or AKEEBADELUXE
          levels), please log in first. You should then see an item on this
          page reading Akeeba Backup Professional. Click on it to download the
          ZIP installation package.</para>

          <para>All Akeeba Backup installation packages contain the component,

          plugins and all translation files. Installing it will install all of
          the above items automatically. The installation package can be
          installed on both Joomla! 1.5 and Joomla! 1.6 sites. It can also be
          used to upgrade Akeeba Backup; just install it
          <emphasis>without</emphasis> uninstalling the previous

          <warning>
            <para>Akeeba Backup is a big extension (over 2Mb for the

            default configuration does not allow files over 2Mb to be
            uploaded. To work around that, left-click on the WAMP icon (the
            green W), click on <guimenu>PHP</guimenu>,

            <title>Manual installation</title>

            <para>Sometimes <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> is unable to
            properly extract ZIP archives due to technical limitations on your
            server. In this case, you can follow a manual installation
            procedure.</para>

            <para>First, you have to extract the installation ZIP file in a
            subdirectory named <filename>akeeba</filename> on your local PC.
            Then, upload the entire subdirectory inside your site's temporary
            directory. At this point, there should be a subdirectory named
            <filename>akeeba</filename> inside your site's temporary directory
            which contains all of the ZIP package's files.</para>

            <para>If you are unsure where your site's temporary directory is
            located, you can look it up by going to the <guimenuitem>Global

            <guilabel>Server</guilabel> tab and take a look at the
            <guilabel>Path to Temp-folder</guilabel> setting. The default
            setting is the <filename>tmp</filename> directory under your
            site's root. Rarely, especially on automated installations using
            Fantastico, this might have been assigned the system-wide
            <filename>/tmp</filename> directory. In this case, please consult
            your host for instructions on how to upload files inside this
            directory, or about changing your <trademark>Joomla!</trademark>
            temporary directory back to the default location and making it
            writable.</para>

            <para>Assuming that you are past this uploading step, click on the

            filled in with the absolute path to your temporary directory, for
            example <filename>/var/www/joomla/tmp</filename>. Please append
            <filename>/akeeba</filename> to it. As per our example, it should
            look something like

        Panel, it will automatically check for the existence of an updated
        version and it will notify you. Clicking on the notification allows
        you to perform a live update without further interaction. Do note that
        if your server is protected by a firewall you'll have to enable port
        80 and 443 TCP traffic to www.akeebabackup.com and joomlacode.org for

      manner, we chose to present the individual pages in the same manner they
      appear on the component's Control Panel page, i.e. the first page which
      is presented to you when you launch the component's back-end. Some of

          contained subdirectories and files 0755 permissions
          (read/write/execute for the owner, read/execute for group and

          <para>If you see a blank page instead of the Control Panel, you may

          <guimenu>Help</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>System Info</guimenuitem> menu

          use <application>Akeeba Backup</application> on your server before
          upgrading to PHP 5.2 or later.</para>

          <important>
            <para>Even though the Control Panel may load in PHP 5.0.x or
            5.1.x, the backup won't run on such old versions of PHP. You can
            check your PHP version by going to your site's System Information
            menu item. We strongly suggest that you use the latest PHP 5.2.x
            or 5.3.x version for optimal operation of the component.</para>

                <para>In this panel you can find information regarding the
                status of your backup output directory. <application>Akeeba
                Backup</application> will warn you if this directory is
                unwritable. If the text reads that there are potential
                problems you <emphasis role="bold">must</emphasis> take a look
                at the details below to find out what these might be!</para>

                  <para>No matter what the PHP Safe Mode setting is, it is
                  possible that your host enforces open_basedir restrictions
                  which only allow you to have an output directory under a
                  handful of predefined locations. On this occasion,
                  <application>Akeeba Backup</application> will report the
                  folder unwritable even though you might have enforced 0777
                  (read, write and execute allowed for all) permissions. These
                  restrictions are reported in the section below the overall
                  status text as an item entitled "open_basedir
                  restrictions".</para>
                </important>

                <para>If any potential problems have been detected, right
                below the overall status you will find one or several warnings
                links. Just click on each warning's description to get a pop
                up window explaining the potential problem, its impact on your
                backup and precautionary or corrective steps you can take. If
                this section is empty, no detectable problems were found; this
                is a good thing, indeed!</para>

                  <para>You are supposed to read the full text of the warnings
                  by clicking on each item. Quite often users post for support
                  on our forum asking something which is already written in
                  the full text of the warnings. Please, DO NOT seek support

          <para>The left navigation panel set allows access to the different
          functions of the component, by clicking on each icon.</para>

          <para>There are two icons which need special mention, the updates
          icon and the Component Parameters icon.</para>

          <para>Since Akeeba Backup 3.2 there is a "Live Update" feature
          integrated in the navigation panel. Every time you display the
          Control Panel page, Akeeba Backup will query AkeebaBackup.com for
          the existence of a new release and cache this data for a maximum of
          24 hours. If it discovers that your version is out of date, it will
          allow you to upgrade to the latest release by clicking on the update
          icon which displays as the last item of the <guilabel>Basic
          Operations</guilabel> set of icons. If this doesn't work on your
          host, you can always update manually, as explained earlier in this
          document.</para>

          <para><important>
              <para>For this feature to work you must ensure that your server
              can communicate with akeebabackup.com. If you are behind a
              firewall, make sure that you open TCP traffic over port 80 and
              443 to www.akeebabackup.com (our update server location) and
              joomlacode.org (our file repository system).</para>
            </important></para>

          <para>If you are a subscriber to the Professional release, the live
          update will not work properly unless you also specify your
          AkeebaBackup.com Download ID in the Component Parameters page. Since
          the Professional release is provided on a subscription basis,
          whenever you ask Akeeba Backup to update it, it has to provide your
          Download ID to our site to verify that you have a valid subscription
          before downloading the update installation package. You can find out
          your Download ID by logging in to AkeebaBackup.com and clicking on
          the My Subscriptions item on the right-hand user menu module.</para>

          <para>The Component Parameters button allows you to edit
          component-wide parameters, i.e. settings which apply to all backup
          profiles. These options are mentioned in the following
          section.</para>

            <para>The second-to-last icon in the <guilabel>Basic
            Operations</guilabel> set is titled <guibutton>Component
            Parameters</guibutton>. Clicking on it will open the editor page
            in a modal dialog (lightbox) on your browser. These parameters

            <para>Do note that this popup looks slightly differently in
            Joomla! 1.6, i.e. it has tabs for each set of options instead of
            horizontal ruler lines to separate them. However, the naming of
            the options and their associated meaning is exactly the
            same.</para>

                  privileges required to access <application>Akeeba
                  Backup</application>'s backup functionality. Remember that
                  giving someone access to Akeeba Backup is like giving him a
                  free pass to all of your site's configuration options,
                  including those in your configuration.php file, i.e.
                  database and FTP connection details. Never, ever give access
                  to people who you don't fully trust. That's why the default
                  setting is Super Administrators, which allows only Super
                  Administrators (by definition full access users) to access
                  the component.</para>

                  <important>
                    <para>Even if you have a third party ACL system, such as
                    JUGA, this setting will work on top of your system. If you
                    have set this setting to Super Administrators and try to
                    give a Manager access to the component through the ACL
                    system he won't be able to use it. Even though your ACL
                    system will let her through, Akeeba Backup's own setting
                    will slam the door on her face. You have been

          <para>Akeeba Backup 3.1.5 and later include the Configuration Wizard
          feature. This is an automated process which will benchmark your
          server's performance and try to fine tune common configuration
          variables for optimal backup performance. The Configuration Wizard
          settings are applied to the current profile only. If you want to

          drop-down list in the Control Panel page before clicking on the
          <guibutton>Configuration Wizard</guibutton> button. Do note that
          using the Configuration Wizard has the following effects:</para>

            <para>Some options discussed below may be only available in the
            for-a-fee Professional edition!</para>
          </note>

          <para>The Configuration page is split in many sections - or panes,
          if you like - each one serving as a group for closely related
          options. Each of those panes displays a title and below it you can
          find all of the options. Hovering your mouse of the label - the left
          hand part of each row - you will be presented with a quite big
          tooltip providing short documentation of the setting and its
          available options. This way you won't have to refer to this document
          constantly when configuring Akeeba Backup.</para>

          <para>Some of the settings also feature a button. They can either do
          some action, like browsing for a folder and testing connection
          parameters, or it may be labeled
          <guibutton>Configure...</guibutton>. This latter case is mostly
          interesting, as pressing the button will toggle the display of a
          sub-pane which contains options pertaining to this specific option.
          This GUI pattern is primarily used for "engines" type
          settings.</para>

          <para>Another interface element worth mentioning are the composite
          drop-downs. Whenever you are supposed to enter a number,
          <application>Akeeba Backup</application> presents you with a
          drop-down menu of the most common options. You can either select a
          value from the list, or select "Custom...". In the latter case, a
          text box appears to the right of the drop-down. You can now type in
          your desired value, even if it's not on the list. Do note that all
          of these elements have preset minimum/maximum values. If you attempt
          to enter a value outside those boundaries, or an invalid number,
          they will automatically revert to the closest value which is within
          the presents bounds.</para>

          <note>
            <para>If you had been using earlier releases of Akeeba Backup, you
            will remember that these values used to use a draggable slider.
            Since the slider was rather "jumpy" and hard to configure, we
            reverted to using composite drop-downs in order to make entry of
            settings easier and faster.</para>

          <para>On the top of the page you can see the numeric ID and title of
          the active backup profile. This acts as a reminder, so that you know
          which profile's settings you are editing. The toolbar also contains
          a <guibutton>Parameters</guibutton> button. Clicking on it will
          launch the profile-independent, component-wide parameters editor.
          It's the same as clicking the <guibutton>Component
          Parameters</guibutton> button in the Control Panel.</para>

          <para>The rest of this document is separated into sub-sections. The

                        only backs up the files which changed since the last
                        time you performed a backup. The only comparison made
                        is between the file's modification time and the last
                        successful backup's time. The "last successful backup"
                        refers to the last backup made using this backup
                        Profile and which has a status of "OK" or
                        "Obsolete".</para>

                        <para>Restoring an incremental backup set is a

                        manually extract the files from your "base" backup (an
                        archive made with a <guilabel>Full Site
                        Backup</guilabel> profile), then extract all
                        incremental archives on top of it. Finally, used this
                        collection of extracted files to restore your site.
                        This process should only be used if you really know
                        what you are doing. Do not trust that Akeeba Backup
                        can sort out the collection of incremental backups and
                        help you restore them. It won't.</para>

                  <term>Use IFRAMEs instead of AJAX</term>

                  <listitem>
                    <para>Normally, Akeeba Backup is using AJAX postbacks to
                    perform the backup process without timing out. Its ability
                    to do so depends on how well your server plays along with
                    your browser's Javascript engine. Sometimes, this is just
                    not possible at all and you'll experience the backup
                    stalling at random points through the backup process. If
                    modifying the other options doesn't help, enable this
                    feature. When enabled, instead of using AJAX calls, Akeeba
                    Backup will create a hidden IFRAME in the page and perform
                    all server communications through it. Since IFRAMEs load
                    the backup URL as if it were a regular web page, it
                    minimizes the probability of conflicts. The major drawback
                    is that this method is about 50% slower than the AJAX one,
                    so your backup will take substantially longer.</para>

                  <listitem>
                    <para>Normally, Akeeba Backup stores temporary information
                    required to process the backup in multiple steps inside
                    files in your Output Directory. Sometimes, especially on
                    low-end hosts with ancient versions of PHP, this causes
                    backup issues such as the backup restarting all the time.
                    In those cases, you can check this box and Akeeba Backup
                    will use your site's database to store this temporary
                    information.</para>

                    <para>Do note that on some hosts this will cause the
                    backup to fail with a "MySQL server has gone away" error
                    message. That is a problem with the host's configuration.
                    In those cases, nothing can be done. Our suggestion: if
                    you receive such an error, migrate your site to a new host
                    as the one you are using is most likely very restricted
                    and severely under-performant. Moving to a faster, more
                    reliable host can benefit your site in many more ways than
                    just being able to run a backup.</para>

                    is YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TIMEZONE. This means that you have
                    to specify the year as four digits, followed by a dash,
                    then the month as two digits (e.g. 09 for September),
                    followed by a dash, then the day as two digits (e.g. 01
                    for the 1st day of the month). For example, September 1st,
                    2010 is written as 2010-09-01. If you want to specify the
                    time, leave a space after the date and write down the time
                    as the hour using two digits (00-23, no a.m./p.m. is
                    supported!), then a semicolon, then the minutes as two
                    digits, followed by a semicolon, then the seconds as two

                    as 23:05:59. You can optionally leave a space after the
                    time and specify the timezone as GMT+/-time. For example,
                    GMT-6 is Dallas time which is six hours behind the GMT and
                    GMT+2 is two hours ahead of GMT which is the Eastern

                    <para>Akeeba Backup is able to split your MySQL database
                    dump to smaller files. This allows for an improved
                    compression ratio and also helps avoid several problems
                    with certain cheap hosts which put a restriction on the
                    maximum size a file generated by PHP code can have.</para>

                    <para>Ideally, you should specify a setting which is about

                    threshold</guilabel> setting in the archiver engine's
                    configuration options pane. The reason to do that is that
                    the archiver engines will not compress files with sizes
                    over the value this threshold. Since it's impossible to
                    have absolute control of the size of the database dump,
                    using half the value of this setting allows for the

                    <para>Dumping table data happens in "batches", i.e. a few
                    rows at a time. This parameter defines how many rows will
                    be fetched from the table at any given time. If you are
                    backing up tables with large chunks of binary data (e.g.
                    files stored in BLOB fields) or if you have very large
                    chunks of text stored in the database, the default value -
                    1000 rows - may cause a PHP memory or MySQL buffer
                    exhaustion. If you get memory outage errors during the
                    table backup, it is advisable to lower this setting. This
                    is especially true if your MySQL and PHP combination does
                    not allow a cursor to be effectively created and all data
                    has to be transferred in PHP's memory. A value of 20 is a
                    very safe value, at the expense of making your backup
                    process slower and run more queries against your database
                    server. Most servers work fine with the default value of

                    <application>Akeeba Backup</application>'s engine might
                    consume another 5Mb, so plan this value carefully, or you
                    will run into memory exhaustion errors. Compression is
                    also resource intensive and will increase the time to
                    produce a backup. If this value is too high, you might run
                    into timeout errors.</para>

              <para>The JPA format was conceived as an alternative to ZIP,
              designed to be extremely suitable for PHP scripts. The trick is
              that the JPA format doesn't store a checksum for each file -
              therefore it reduces the processing overhead during archiving -
              and it doesn't use a "lookup table" (central directory) as ZIP
              does. Both of these design decisions lead to extremely fast, low
              resource usage archiving processes.</para>

              <tip>
                <para>It is recommended that you use the JPA format for all of
                your backups. You can extract JPA files either on your server

              <note>

                Professional release.</para>
              </note>

              <para>The JPS is a further evolution of the JPA format, designed
              with the major goals of improving compression rations and
              enhancing the security of your data by encrypting the entire
              archive's contents with the industry standard AES-128 encryption
              format. The latter goal ensures that even in the unlikely event
              of your backup files ending up in the hands of hacker or another
              untrusted party, they would be useless. As per the strictest
              security standards, all information in the archive (including
              file names and file data) are encrypted. Without the password
              nobody can deduct any information about your site by examining a
              JPS archive. The contents of all files in the archive are
              compressed and encrypted in 64Kb blocks, allowing for better
              compression ratios over the JPA format.</para>

              <important>
                <para>In order for JPS to work it requires that both the zlib
                and mcrypt PHP extensions are installed and activated on your
                server. Moreover, the mcrypt library installed on the server
                must support AES-128 in CBC mode. If any of these conditions
                is not met, the backup process will halt with an error
                mentioning that encryption is not enabled on your server. In
                this case, please contact your host with the information in
                this paragraph so that they can perform the necessary
                server-side changes.</para>
              </important>

              <important>
                <para>JPS archives can only be extracted on hosts fulfilling
                the same per-requisites (zlib and mcrypt extensions installed
                and activated). They can also be extracted only by Kickstart
                3.1.2 and Akeeba eXtract Wizard 3.0.4 or later. Earlier
                version can't read the JPS archives at all.</para>

                    ("symlinks"), it follows them and treats them as regular
                    files and directories, backing up their contents. Some
                    site configurations may have symbolic links set up in such

                    <application>Akeeba Backup</application> will not follow
                    symbolic links, but store their name and their target in
                    the archive. Of course, if your symbolic links use
                    absolute paths, restoring to a different server than the
                    one you backed up from will result in broken

                    <para><application>Akeeba Backup</application> supports
                    the creation of Split Archives. In a nutshell, your backup
                    archive is spanned among one or several files, so that
                    each of these files ("part") is not bigger than the value
                    you specify here. This is a useful feature for hosts which
                    impose a maximum file size quota. If you use a value of
                    0Mb, no archive splitting will take place and
                    <application>Akeeba Backup</application> will produce a
                    single backup archive (default).</para>

                      <para>If you want to post-process your archive files it

                      The time it takes the post-processing engine to transfer
                      an archive from your server to the remote server equals
                      part size divided by available bandwidth. Since the
                      available execution time is finite and the available
                      bandwidth is constant, the only way to avoid a timeout
                      is creating small parts.</para>

                <para>This feature is not meant for everyday users. It is
                designed for web professionals. If you don't understand the
                rest of this section, please do not use it.
                <application>Akeeba Backup</application> is equally useful as
                a site migration tool without using DirectFTP.</para>
              </important>

              <para>The DirectFTP engine allows power users to directly export
              a website from one server to another, without the need to
              download the backup file to their PC, upload it and extract it
              on the other server. In order to do so, instead of backing up to
              an archive, it directly writes the backed up files to the remote
              server using FTP, hence the name.</para>

              <para>Do note that when using the DirectFTP engine, the
              post-processing engine will not run, as there is no archive
              produced.</para>

              <para>In a nutshell, when this option is activated,
              <application>Akeeba Backup</application> operates as usual,
              backing up your database and files. Instead of putting the site
              files, installer files and database dump inside a backup
              archive, it transfers them to a remote server using FTP. You can
              then visit the installation URL on the remote server to complete
              the site transfer progress.</para>

              <warning>
                <para>This is considered an advanced feature. Since there are
                many things which might go wrong in the process and due to the
                fact that the success of the operation depends on the server
                configuration of both the originating and target servers, you
                are advised not to use it unless you know what you're
                doing.</para>

                <para>Moreover, bear in mind that the target server
                <emphasis>must not</emphasis> contain any files! If it does,
                it may not be possible to overwrite them, leading to an
                incomplete site transfer.</para>
              </warning>

              <para>Your originating server must support PHP's FTP extensions
              and not have its FTP functions blocked. Your originating server
              must not block FTP communication to the remote (target) server.
              Some hosts apply a firewall policy which requires you to specify
              to which hosts your server can connect. In such a case you might
              need to allow communication to your remote host.</para>

              <para>Normally, remote FTP connections consume a lot of time,
              therefore DirectFTP is very prone to time-outs. Theoretically,
              <application>Akeeba Backup</application> can automatically
              estimate the time required for transferring each file and avoid
              timing out. However, this is not always technically possible. In
              such a case you might want to lower the maximum execution time
              allowance and bias in the Configuration. Do note that large
              files have to be transferred in a single step, as most PHP and
              FTP configuration combinations disallow resuming uploads
              (chunked uploads). This means that a very large file, or a very
              large database dump may cause the process to fail with a timeout
              error.</para>

                    FTP transfers, which usually requires tweaking the
                    firewall!</para>

                <para>This feature is only available in the Akeeba Backup
                Professional edition.</para>
              </important>

              <important>
                <para>This feature is not meant for everyday users. It is
                designed for web professionals. If you don't understand the
                rest of this section, please do not use it.
                <application>Akeeba Backup</application> is equally useful as
                a site migration tool without using DirectSFTP.</para>
              </important>

              <para>The DirectSFTP engine allows power users to directly
              export a website from one server to another, without the need to
              download the backup file to their PC, upload it and extract it
              on the other server. In order to do so, instead of backing up to
              an archive, it directly writes the backed up files to the remote
              server using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol over SSH),
              hence the name.</para>

              <para>Do note that when using the DirectSFTP engine, the
              post-processing engine will not run, as there is no archive
              produced.</para>

              <para>In a nutshell, when this option is activated,
              <application>Akeeba Backup</application> operates as usual,
              backing up your database and files. Instead of putting the site
              files, installer files and database dump inside a backup
              archive, it transfers them to a remote server using SFTP. You
              can then visit the installation URL on the remote server to
              complete the site transfer progress.</para>

              <warning>
                <para>This is considered an advanced feature. Since there are
                many things which might go wrong in the process and due to the
                fact that the success of the operation depends on the server
                configuration of both the originating and target servers, you
                are advised not to use it unless you know what you're
                doing.</para>

                <para>Moreover, bear in mind that the target server
                <emphasis>must not</emphasis> contain any files! If it does,
                it may not be possible to overwrite them, leading to an
                incomplete site transfer.</para>
              </warning>

              <para>Your originating server (where you are backing up
              <emphasis>from</emphasis>) must a. support PHP's SSH2
              extensions, b. allow outbound TCP/IP connections to your target
              host's SSH port and c. not have the SFTP functions of the SSH2
              extension blocked. Please note that some hosts apply a firewall
              policy which requires you to specify to which hosts your server
              can connect. In such a case you might need to allow
              communication to your remote host. Moreover, your target host
              must support SFTP connections using a username and password for
              authentication. If your remote server only allows authentication
              using certificate files it won't work with Akeeba Backup's
              DirectSFTP feature.</para>

              <para>Normally, remote SFTP connections consume a lot of time,
              therefore DirectSFTP is very prone to time-outs. Theoretically,
              <application>Akeeba Backup</application> can automatically
              estimate the time required for transferring each file and avoid
              timing out. However, this is not always technically possible. In
              such a case you might want to lower the maximum execution time
              allowance and bias in the Configuration. Do note that large
              files have to be transferred in a single step, as most PHP and
              SFTP configuration combinations disallow resuming uploads
              (chunked uploads). This means that a very large file, or a very
              large database dump may cause the process to fail with a timeout
              error.</para>

              <title>ZIP using ZIPArchive class</title>

              <para>This engine produces ZIP archive using PHP's built-in ZIP
              archive class. It is only recommended for extremely small sites
              hosted on very slow hosts. If you have a larger site or quite
              big files you can expect that this engine will time out, crash
              the backup or throw a memory outage error. Also note that this
              engine has absolutely no options and is bound to fail on hosts
              which impose limitations on the maximum size per file.</para>

              <para>Frankly, this is the worst archiver engine. It was added
              because some users argued that it is faster (it is not) and this
              is why it is being used by competitive products. Well, try it
              out if you want. As soon as it causes backup errors do not ask
              for support, just switch to the classic ZIP engine or, even
              better, the JPA engine.</para>

              <para>This handy feature is available both in Akeeba Backup Core
              and Akeeba Backup Professional. It will send you the backup
              archive parts as file attachments to your email address. That's
              right! No need to worry about downloading your backup archives,
              they will be emailed to you. That said, beware of the
              restrictions:</para>

                the <guilabel>Archiver engine</guilabel> to a value between
                1-10 Megabytes. If you choose a big value (or leave the
                default value of 0, which means that no split archives will be
                generated) you run the risks of the process timing out, a
                memory outage error to occur or, finally, your email servers
                not being able to cope with the attachment size, dropping the
                email.</para>

                    option, the email process will take place after the backup
                    is complete and finalized. This ensures that if the email
                    process fails a valid backup will still be stored on your
                    server. The drawback is that it requires more available

              <para>Using this engine, you can upload your backup archives to
              the Amazon S3 cloud storage service. With dirt cheap prices per
              Gigabyte, it is an ideal option for securing your backups. Even
              if your host's data center is annihilated by a natural disaster
              and your local PC and storage media are wiped out by an unlikely
              event, you will still have a copy of your site readily
              accessible and easy to restore.</para>

              <para>Since Akeeba Backup 3.2 we support multi-part uploads to
              Amazon S3. This means that, unlike the other post-processing
              engines, even if you do not use split archives, Akeeba Backup
              will still be able to upload your files to Amazon S3! This new
              feature allows Akeeba Backup to upload your backup archive in
              5Mb chunks so that it doesn't time out when uploading a very big
              archive file. That said, we STRONGLY suggest using a part size
              for archive splitting of 2000Mb. This is required to work around
              a PHP limitation which causes extraction to fail if the file
              size is over roughly 2Gb.</para>

                    parts over 5Mb use Amazon's new multi-part upload feature.
                    This allows Akeeba Backup to upload the backup archive in
                    5Mb chunks and then ask Amazon S3 to glue them together in
                    one big file. However, some hosts time out while uploading
                    archives using this method. In that case it's preferable
                    to use a relatively small Part Size for Split Archive
                    setting (around 10-20Mb, your mileage may vary) and upload
                    the entire archive part in one go. Enabling this option
                    ensures that, no matter how big or small your Part Size
                    for Split Archives setting is, the upload of the backup
                    archive happens in one go. You MUST use it if you get

              <title>Upload to DropBox</title>

              <para>Using this engine, you can upload your backup archives to
              the low-cost DropBox cloud storage service (<link
              xlink:href="http://www.dropbox.com"
              xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.dropbox.com</link>).
              This is an ideal option for small websites with a low budget, as
              this service offers 2Gb of storage space for free, all the while
              retaining all the pros of storing your files on the cloud. Even
              if your host's data center is annihilated by a natural disaster
              and your local PC and storage media are wiped out by an unlikely
              event, you will still have a copy of your site readily
              accessible and easy to restore.</para>

              <para>Before you begin, you should know the limitations. DropBox
              does not allow appending to files, so the archive has to be
              transferred in a single step. PHP has a time limit restriction
              we can't overlook. The time required to upload a file to DropBox
              equals the size of the file divided by the available bandwidth.
              We want to time to upload a file to be less than PHP's time
              limit restriction so as to avoid timing out. Since the available
              bandwidth is finite and constant, the only thing we can reduce
              in order to avoid timeouts is the file size. To this end, you
              have to produce split archives, by setting the <guilabel>part
              size for archive splitting</guilabel> in ZIP's or JPA's engine
              configuration pane. The suggested values are between 10Mb and
              20Mb. Most servers have a bandwidth cap of 20Mbits, which equals
              to roughly 2Mb/sec (1 byte is 8 bits, plus there's some traffic
              overhead, lost packets, etc). With a time limit of 10 seconds,
              we can upload at most 2 Mb/sec * 10 sec = 20Mb without timing
              out. If you get timeouts during post-processing lower the part
              size.</para>

              <tip>
                <para>If you use the native CRON mode (backup.php), there is
                usually no time limit - or there is a very high time limit in
                the area of 3 minutes or so. Ask your host about it. Setting
                up a profile for use only with the native CRON mode allows you
                to increase the part size and reduce the number of parts a
                complete backup consists of.</para>
              </tip>

              <warning>
                <para>You can not upload files over 50Mb to DropBox using
                Akeeba Backup's post-processing engine. This is a limitation
                of the engine. We regret to inform you that there is no
                workaround to this.</para>
              </warning>

              <para>You should also note that we do not use DropBox's official
              API, because the way it works would mean that Akeeba Backup
              would instantly time out or throw a memory outage error when
              trying to upload files from the majority of shared hosting
              plans. The solution used in Akeeba Backup is a "workaround"; it
              logs you in DropBox's web file management interface and tries to
              use the web upload form for storing your files. This has two
              major consequences. First, the login procedure takes a
              substantial amount of time (1-3 seconds, depending on your
              connection speed), which limits the maximum file size you may
              use. Second, if DropBox.com decides to change something in the
              way their site works, this feature will probably stop working.
              As a result, until the official DropBox API is modified for
              taking into account large file uploads from restrictive PHP
              environments, this storage option should only be used when you
              are very low on budget and accept the risk of it suddenly
              stopping working.</para>

                    The drawback with enabling this option is that if the

                    option, the upload process will take place after the
                    backup is complete and finalized. This ensures that if the
                    upload process fails a valid backup will still be stored
                    on your server. The drawback is that it requires more

                    on your server. The drawback is that it requires more

              <title>Upload to Microsoft Windows Azure BLOB Storage
              service</title>

              <para>Using this engine, you can upload your backup archives to
              the <link
              xlink:href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/windowsazure/"
              xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Microsoft Windows
              Azure BLOB Storage</link> cloud storage service. This new cloud
              storage service from Microsoft is reasonably priced (the cost is
              very close to CloudFiles) and quite fast, with lots of local
              endpoints around the globe.</para>

              <warning>
                <para>Azure, unlike other cloud storage providers, doesn't
                support storing files over 64Mb without resorting to
                proprietary hacks. As a result you MUST use a part size for
                archive splitting lower than 64Mb at all times. Failure to do
                so might cause your backup uploads to fail.</para>
              </warning>

              <para>Before you begin, you should know the limitations. As most
              cloud storage providers, Azure does not allow appending to
              files, so the archive has to be transferred in a single step.
              PHP has a time limit restriction we can't overlook. The time
              required to upload a file to CloudFiles equals the size of the
              file divided by the available bandwidth. We want to time to
              upload a file to be less than PHP's time limit restriction so as
              to avoid timing out. Since the available bandwidth is finite and
              constant, the only thing we can reduce in order to avoid
              timeouts is the file size. To this end, you have to produce
              split archives, by setting the <guilabel>part size for archive
              splitting</guilabel> in ZIP's or JPA's engine configuration
              pane. The suggested values are between 10Mb and 20Mb. Most
              servers have a bandwidth cap of 20Mbits, which equals to roughly
              2Mb/sec (1 byte is 8 bits, plus there's some traffic overhead,
              lost packets, etc). With a time limit of 10 seconds, we can
              upload at most 2 Mb/sec * 10 sec = 20Mb without timing out. If
              you get timeouts during post-processing lower the part
              size.</para>

              <tip>
                <para>If you use the native CRON mode (backup.php), there is
                usually no time limit - or there is a very high time limit in
                the area of 3 minutes or so. Ask your host about it. Setting
                up a profile for use only with the native CRON mode allows you
                to increase the part size and reduce the number of parts a
                complete backup consists of.</para>
              </tip>

              <para>Akeeba Backup is using the very stable official PHP
              bindings for Microsoft Windows Azure access, which is unlikely
              to stop working for the foreseeable future. As a result, we
              consider it a good candidate for backup archives storage.</para>

              <para>Using this engine, you can upload your backup archives to
              any FTP or FTPS (FTP over implicit SSL) server. There are some
              "FTP" protocols and other file storage protocols which are not
              supported, such as SFTP, SCP, Secure FTP, FTP over explicit SSL
              and SSH variants. The difference of this engine to the DirectFTP
              archiver engine is that this engine uploads backup archives to
              the server, whereas DirectFTP uploads the uncompressed files of
              your site. DirectFTP is designed for rapid migration, this
              engine is designed for easy moving of your backup archives to an
              off-server location.</para>

              <para>Your originating server must support PHP's FTP extensions
              and not have its FTP functions blocked. Your originating server
              must not block FTP communication to the remote (target) server.
              Some hosts apply a firewall policy which requires you to specify
              to which hosts your server can connect. In such a case you might
              need to allow communication to your remote host.</para>

              <para>Before you begin, you should know the limitations. Most
              servers do not allow resuming of uploads (or even if they do,
              PHP doesn't quite support this feature), so the archive has to
              be transferred in a single step. PHP has a time limit
              restriction we can't overlook. The time required to upload a
              file to FTP equals the size of the file divided by the available
              bandwidth. We want to time to upload a file to be less than
              PHP's time limit restriction so as to avoid timing out. Since
              the available bandwidth is finite and constant, the only thing
              we can reduce in order to avoid timeouts is the file size. To
              this end, you have to produce split archives, by setting the
              <guilabel>part size for archive splitting</guilabel> in ZIP's or
              JPA's engine configuration pane. The suggested values are
              between 10Mb and 20Mb. Most servers have a bandwidth cap of

              there's some traffic overhead, lost packets, etc). With a time
              limit of 10 seconds, we can upload at most 2 Mb/sec * 10 sec =
              20Mb without timing out. If you get timeouts during
              post-processing lower the part size.</para>

          <para>Before we go on describing the Backup Now page, we have to
          discuss something important pertaining to the overall backup and
          restoration process. In order for the restoration to work properly,
          the original site must have a readable and valid configuration.php
          on its root. This means that a 'trick' many webmasters use, that is
          providing a configuration.php which includes an off-server-root PHP
          file, is incompatible with the restoration procedure. If the 'trick'
          has been effective on the original site, the installer will have
          blanks in its options and if the user proceeds with the
          restoration/installation procedure the site will not work as
          expected, as crucial options will have the default or no value at
          all!</para>

          <para>That being said, the initial backup page lets you define a
          short description (required) and an optional lengthy comment for
          this backup attempt. This information will be presented to you in
          the backup administration page to help you identify different
          backups. The default description contains the date and time of
          backup. Both the description and comment will be stored in a file
          named <filename>README.html</filename> inside your archive's
          <filename>installation</filename> directory, but only if the backup
          mode is full backup.</para>

          <para>Since Akeeba Backup 3.1.b1 both the description and the
          comment support Akeeba Backup's file naming "variables", e.g.
          <varname>[SITE]</varname>, <varname>[DATE]</varname> and
          <varname>[TIME]</varname>. These variables are documented in the
          <link linkend="config-output-directory">Output Directory</link>
          configuration option's description. It goes without saying, but
          these variables can also be used in the case of automated backups,
          e.g. CRON-mode backups.</para>

          <para>Whenever you are ready to start the backup, just click the
          <guibutton>Backup Now</guibutton> button. Do note that above the
          description field, there might be one or more warnings. These are
          the same warnings appearing in the Control Panel's right-hand pane
          and act as a reminder.</para>

          <important>
            <para><guilabel>Default output directory is in use</guilabel>
            <emphasis>is not an error message</emphasis>! It's just a reminder
            that the default output directory is a well known location on your
            site. In theory, a malicious user could figure out the name of the
            backup archive and download it directly over the web. In order to
            deter that, Akeeba Backup places a .htaccess file (compatible with
            virtually all Apache installations) and a web.config file
            (compatible only with IIS 7) to deter that. If you are using a
            host which doesn't support the directives of those two files, the
            contents of that directory may be inadvertently available over the
            web to malicious users. If in doubt, ask your host. Do not ask us.
            We can't know this information; we haven't set up your host's
            server.</para>

            <para>Our recommendation: consult your host about the proper way
            to create a backup output directory above your site's root and
            make it writable by PHP. Then, use that directory as the Output
            Directory in all of your backup profiles. This method offers the
            greatest degree of protection.</para>

          <para>Once you click on the <guibutton>Backup Now</guibutton>
          button, the backup progress page appears. You must not navigate away
          from this page or close your browser window until the backup is
          complete. Otherwise, the backup process will be interrupted and no
          backup file will be created (or you'll end up with an incomplete
          backup file). <application>Akeeba Backup</application> disables the
          Joomla! menu during backup to prevent accidentally switching to a
          different page. If, however, the timeout bar (the second one which
          looks as a progress bar and changes its color from green to yellow
          to red) fills up, you can safely assume that your backup has
          crashed. Only in this case you should navigate away from the backup
          page and take a look at the log file for any error messages. Always
          try different configuration options - especially toying with the
          minimum execution time - before submitting a bug report on our
          support forum.</para>

          <para>The backup progress page consists of a large pane. The top
          section of the pane lists the steps <application>Akeeba
          Backup</application> has to take in order to complete your backup.
          Steps in gray background have not been dealt with yet. Steps in
          green background, featuring a green check mark on the left-hand
          side, have been successfully completed. The step in yellow
          background, featuring a blue arrow on the left-hand side, is the one
          being currently processed.</para>

          <para>Below that, you will find two lines, called Step/Substep in
          Akeeba Backup jargon. The first line will show you which table or
          directory has <emphasis role="bold">been backed up until
          now</emphasis>. This is very important. When the backup crashes, it
          hasn't crashed on the table or directory you see on the screen! In
          fact, you can be sure that this table/directory has been
          <emphasis>successfully</emphasis> backed up. The real problem
          appears in the log file and this is why we are adamant in asking for
          a backup log to be posted with your support request. The Substep
          line below is normally used for messages of lesser importance, such
          as noting the percentage of a table already completed (especially
          useful when backing up huge tables) and the name of the archive part
          which was processed by a data processing engine.</para>

          <para>The big bar is the overall progress bar and displays an
          <emphasis>approximation</emphasis> of the backup progress. Do note
          that during file backup you may see this bar jump back and forth.
          This is normal and, please, do not report it as a bug. It is exactly
          how it is supposed to behave. The reason is rather simple. Before
          your site is backed up, Akeeba Backup doesn't know how many files
          and directories it contains. As a result, it tries to do an educated
          guess and display an approximate backup progress. Guesswork is never
          accurate, which causes some jumping back and forth. Nothing to worry
          about, your backup is working without a problem.</para>

          <para>The next thing you see is the "timeout bar". This is not a
          progress bar. This bar counts the time elapsed while running the
          current step. Each time a new backup step starts, it resets to zero.
          The bar changes color from green to yellow to red. Green means that
          it's within the expected limits. Yellow means that we have exceeded
          the time we expected to consume, but are still within the configured
          limits. The red area means that this step is taking substantially
          more time than we expected. This doesn't mean that your backup is
          stuck; it may just be network latency or other unexpected issues
          which delay the server response. Do not consider the backup failed
          unless you either see an error page, or the timeout bar fills up all
          the way to the right - which means no server response was received
          within 3 minutes, which is just too long, therefore the backup has
          most probably failed.</para>

          <para>Should a minor (non fatal) error occur, <application>Akeeba
          Backup</application> displays a new <guilabel>Warnings</guilabel>
          pane with yellow background. This box holds the warnings which have
          occurred during the backup process, in chronological order. These
          are also logged in the Akeeba Backup Debug Log and marked with the
          WARNING label, that is if your log level is at least Errors and
          Warnings. Usual causes of warnings are unreadable files and
          directories. <application>Akeeba Backup</application> regards them
          as minor errors because, even though the backup process can go
          through, what you get might be a partial backup which doesn't meet
          your expectations. In case warnings appear on your screen you are
          advised to review them and assess their importance.</para>

          backup failure.</para>

          <para>By that point, your site backup file has been created. You can
          now navigate out of the backup page and possibly into the backup
          administration page, clicking on the handy button which appears
          below the backup completion message.</para>

              <para>THE INTEGRATED RESTORATION FEATURE MAY DESTROY YOUR SITE
              IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL.</para>

              <para>Remember that you are OVERWRITING your site with the one
              contained in the backup archive. Do not do that on a live site
              unless it is absolutely necessary, i.e. you have already
              destroyed something vital in your site and want to revert to a
              "last known good" state.</para>

              <para>As with any backup restoration method, practise on a local
              testing server first. Don't push your luck by trying a
              potentially dangerous procedure you are unfamiliar with on a
              live server. Many sites have been destroyed by human error,
              augmented by the "bliss of ignorance" effect. Never, ever, under
              any circumstances, attempt a restoration on a live site unless
              you are familiar with the procedure and confident of all the
              steps you take.</para>

              <para>That said, we trust our own software and use it on our
              sites. Do note that we are extremely familiar with the procedure
              and extremely careful when doing restorations. This message
              tries to excessively - if that's ever possible - stress the
              point that you <emphasis>must</emphasis> be careful and that the
              best method to achieve that is practising on a local testing
              server first.</para>
            </warning>

            <para>The integrated restoration feature allows you to easily
            restore a previous backup directly on your server, as long as your
            backup archive still exists on your server of course. The whole
            idea behind this feature is that it is not necessary to manually
            download Kickstart, place it in your site's root and move the
            backup archive from the output directory to the site's root in
            order to perform the restoration. Instead, the integrated
            restoration feature takes care of extracting your backup archive
            directly from the backup output folder into your site's root and
            then allow you to run the embedded installer (Akeeba Backup
            Installer) to complete the restoration procedure.</para>

            <para>The communication between your browser and the archive
            extraction script is encrypted with the AES128 (Rijndael)
            encryption method, using a random key produced as soon as you
            initiate the restoration of a backup archive. This ensures that a
            malicious user can't exploit the restoration script to
            mischievously extract your backup archive in your site's root with
            the intent to steal your database password. The
            encryption/decryption algorithm is implemented with standard PHP
            and Javascript code, eliminating the need for third party
            cryptography libraries and ensuring that under no circumstances
            unencrypted data will be exchanged between the browser and the
            server.</para>

            <para>When you first start the integrated restoration feature, you

                  settings do not allow some files or directories to be
                  created/overwritten the process will fail and your site will

                <listitem>
                  <para>Using this method, each file is first extracted to the
                  temporary directory specified by the current profile and
                  then moved to its final location using FTP. This is a "best
                  effort" approach and can work with most servers. Do note
                  that only unencrypted FTP (plain FTP) is supported. If you
                  choose this option, you'll also have to specify the FTP
                  connection settings.</para>

                  <para>You MUST use this option if you want to restore your
                  backup archive to a different site than the one you are in
                  right now. Just select this option and provide the FTP
                  connection details to the other site before clicking on
                  <guibutton>Start Restoration</guibutton>.</para>

            <para>The default mode is writing directly to files, unless your
            site's Global Configuration indicates that the FTP layer should be
            used.</para>

            <para>In the event that a partial restoration happens, your site
            will be left in a semi-restored state. Trying to access it will
            pop up the restoration script (Akeeba Backup Installer, a.k.a.
            ABI). If you want to retry the restoration using different
            settings, please remove the <filename>installation</filename>
            directory from your site's root manually, for example using FTP,
            before trying to access your site's administrator back-end.</para>

                the next point of this list) to load. Even then, it expects

                known to the <filename>restore.php</filename> script and the

              Professional edition</para>
            </note>

            <para>Since Akeeba Backup 3.2 you have the option to manage backup
            archives stored in a remote storage location, for example Amazon
            S3 or a remote FTP server. You can do that by clicking on the
            <guilabel>Manage remotely stored files</guilabel> link on the far
            right of supported backup records in the Administer Backup Files
            page. Do note that, if you have upgraded from Akeeba Backup 3.0.x
            or 3.1.x, backup records created by older versions of the software
            do not support this feature. Clicking on that link opens a
            lightbox (modal dialog) with the options compatible with your
            backup archive.</para>

            <para>Please note that not all of the following features may
            appear in the dialog. It depends on the remote storage engine used
            for the backup record. All options currently appear only for files
            stored on Amazon S3 and remote FTP.</para>

            <para>The <guibutton>Fetch back to server</guibutton> button will
            automatically download the backup archive from the remote location
            and store it again on your server. This allows you to easily
            import backup archives stored on a remote location back to your
            server's storage so that you can easily restore them on the same
            or a different site. If you are using S3, please make sure that
            the user credentials you have supplied have enough privileges for
            the files to be downloaded (i.e. they don't grant write-only
            access to the bucket). Also make sure that you have adequate free
            disk space on your server for the operation to complete.</para>

            <para>The <guibutton>Delete</guibutton> button will permanently
            delete the archives from the remote storage. There is no
            confirmation. Once you click this button, your remotely stored
            files will be removed.</para>

            <para>Finally, there are links under the <guilabel>Download to

            your browser to download the respective backup archive's part
            directly to your PC. Currently, only Amazon S3 and remote FTP
            support this feature. Do note that the backup archives are
            transferred directly from the remote storage to your PC. They are
            not stored to your site's server. If you want to store them to
            your server, use the <guibutton>Fetch back to server</guibutton>
            button instead.</para>

            <para>If none of the above options are available, Akeeba Backup
            will display an error message. In that case, just close the modal
            dialog.</para>

            <para>After finishing your remote files administration, please
            close the modal dialog by clicking on the X button on its
            top-right corner and <emphasis>reload the Administer Backup Files

            <para>Sometimes you may have accidentally deleted a backup record
            from the Administer Backup Files page, or simply want to restore a
            backup file taken from another site. Normally, the only way to do
            that is to upload the archive file and Kickstart to your site and
            launch the restoration process from there. However, some users
            insisted that they are better off doing that from inside Akeeba
            Backup itself. In order to accommodate for their needs, we
            introduced the Discover and Import Archives features in Akeeba
            Backup 3.2.</para>

            <para>This feature allows you to automatically find and import
            archives stored anywhere on your account. This means that you can
            upload backup archives anywhere in your site's folder structure,
            or even on a private off-site directory and Akeeba Backup will be
            able to import them. All backup archives are imported as backup
            records of the default backup profile (profile with ID #1) and can
            be restored just like any other backup archive.</para>

            <para>In order to launch this feature, go to the Administer Backup
            Files page and click on the <guibutton>Discover and import
            archives</guibutton> button on the toolbar. A new page appears
            which lets you select a directory.</para>

            (Windows, Linux) or Command-click (Mac OS X) the archive you want
            to import. After that, click on the <guibutton>Import the

            you back to the Control Panel page with a message that the import
            operation completed successfully. You can now click on the
            Administer Backup Files button to view the newly imported backup

          restore it. In order to cope with this requirement, Akeeba Backup
          includes fine-grained access control (ACL) since version 3.2. The
          exact ACL method is specific to the platform it's running on.</para>

          <important>
            <para>The following options apply to back-end backups only.
            Front-end backups, including legacy front-end CRON jobs, remote
            backups and Lite Mode backups, are controlled by means of the
            Secret Word you define in the Component Parameters page. These
            backup modes are not controlled by the access control settings
            because they do not require a user to be logged in to take a
            backup; they only require knowledge of the Secret Word.</para>

            <para>When Akeeba Backup runs on Joomla! 1.5, Nooku Server or any
            other CMS distribution based on Joomla! 1.5, there are two levels
            of access control: component access and per-user ACL (permissions)
            settings.</para>

            <para>The first level of access control defines who can access the
            component at all, i.e. who can see its interface. In order to
            configure it, go to <guimenu>Components</guimenu>,
            <guisubmenu>Akeeba Backup</guisubmenu> and click on the
            <guibutton>Component Parameters</guibutton> button. In the
            parameters interface look for the <guilabel>Minimum access
            level</guilabel> option. Each one of the three options has the
            following meaning:</para>

            <para>Please note that this setting has precedence over the
            per-user ACL. This means that if you set this setting to Super
            Administrator, an Administrator will not be able to use Akeeba
            Backup even if you grant him all permissions in the per-user ACL
            settings.</para>

            <para>The second level of access control is per-user ACL. By
            default Super Adminsitrator can do everything, Administrators can
            backup and download backup archives and Managers can only perform
            a backup but not download backup archives or configure the
            component. This feature allows you to have fine grained control
            over what each user can and can not do. To access it go to
            <guimenu>Components</guimenu>, <guisubmenu>Akeeba
            Backup</guisubmenu> and click on the <guibutton>Access

          <title>Site Transfer Wizard</title>

          <note>
            <para>This feature is only available in the for-a-fee Professional
            edition since version 3.3.5</para>
          </note>

          <important>
            <para>While the Site Transfer Wizard may be useful in transferring
            a site to another server, it is neither the optimal nor the only
            way. In fact, you could just as well back your site up, move the
            backup archive to the new server and use Kickstart to restore it.
            Yes, it's that easy. The wizard may make this process easier, but
            it's possible that it doesn't work under some server combinations.
            It's not a bug, it has to do with the way PHP works and how
            different FTP servers are configured between hosts.</para>
          </important>

          <para>Many times you simply want to move your site between hosts,
          e.g. from a local or development server back to the live server or
          move your site from Host A to Host B. Traditionally, this was a
          multi-step process: take a backup, download it to your local PC,
          upload it to the live server, upload Kickstart, run Kickstart and
          finalize the restoration. Since version 2.2 we offer a backup engine
          called DirectFTP which allows you to take a backup directly to a
          remote FTP server instead of an archive. This means that you no
          longer need to download/upload a backup archive or even use
          Kickstart. By the time the backup is finished, you are able to
          simply point your browser to the new host and start the restoration.
          The biggest drawback of this approach was that setting it up was a
          little difficult for novice users. Our Site Transfer Wizard feature
          is here to make using that feature dead simple!</para>

          <para>The Site Transfer Wizard guides you through a series of steps
          which allow you to define the connection parameters to your remote
          server and automatically takes care of all the details necessary for
          moving your site to the new host. It consists of only three simple
          steps.</para>

          <bridgehead>Step 1: Choose your profile</bridgehead>

          <para>The Site Transfer Wizard requires to create a dedicated backup

                past, all of its settings are stored in its dedicated backup
                profile. Selecting this option will recall them and allow you
                to modify them or use the same settings to transfer your site
                again.</para>

                Wizard) as well as any filter options, e.g. directories, files

          <para>Clicking on Next, Akeeba Backup will try to establish an
          FTP/FTPS/SFTP connection to your remote host and upload a small file
          named akeeba_connection_test.png. If that fails, it will let you
          know about the error which occurred so that you can fix it. If you
          have entered an incorrect directory, i.e. it doesn't correspond to
          the location used to store the files accessible through the "URL to
          the remote site" address, you will also get an error telling you
          that you have to fix it.</para>

          <important>
            <para>Not all hosts are able to initiate FTP/FTPS/SFTP connections
            to other servers. The most common limiting factor is a server-side
            firewall which disallows outbound connections. If you are
            perfectly sure that your FTP/FTPS/SFTP connection settings are
            correct and you still can not connect to your remote site, do not
            ask us for support. If you do, we'll tell you to read the
            documentation (this paragraph!). What you have to do instead is to
            contact your current host and ask them to open their firewall so
            that you can connect to your new host through
            FTP/FTPS/SFTP.</para>

            <para>If you get an error about not being able to change to the
            requested directory, you have entered the "FTP/FTPS/SFTP directory
            to the remote site's root" wrong. Please refer to the section
            above about how to determine its correct setting.</para>

            <para>If you get an error reading "Your FTP/FTPS/SFTP directory is
            not defined correctly. You will be redirected back to the previous
            page to correct it. If in doubt about what this means, please read
            our documentation." then you have entered the "FTP/FTPS/SFTP
            directory to the remote site's root" wrong. Please refer to the
            section above about how to determine its correct setting.</para>

            <para>Do not ask for support if you have not read the above and
            followed all of these instructions. Such requests will be deleted

          <bridgehead>Step 3: Transfer your site</bridgehead>

          <para>In the final step, you are ready to transfer your site! Click
          on the button titled <guibutton>Begin the site transfer</guibutton>
          to start transferring your site to the remote host.</para>

          <para>If you get an error message about not being able to write to a
          remote file or directory, please check that this file or directory
          doesn't already exist on your remote site. If it does, try removing
          it or adjust its permissions so that it is writable through
          FTP/FTPS/SFTP. If you are not sure how to do that, please ask your
          host for instructions, as the solution is entirely
          host-specific.</para>

          <para>When the transfer is complete, you will be forwarded to the
          restoration script which was uploaded together with your site's
          files and database dump to the remote server. Follow all of its
          steps to restore your site's database and configure your site so
          that it can be used on the remote host.</para>

          <para>If you end up back on your source site (the one you are
          transferring from), a blank page or an Internal Server Error page,
          please use your favourite FTP client (e.g. FileZilla) to rename or
          remove the <filename>.htaccess</filename> file from the remote site
          and reload the page. Do not contact us for support unless you do
          that first. For your information, it is possible that your .htaccess
          file contains directives which either have a hardcoded site URL in
          them or are simply not compatible with your new host. Renaming the
          file "neutralizes" it and you can access the installation script
          normally. If your new host is GoDaddy, do note that <emphasis>it may
          take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes after you rename .htaccess
          before the changes take any effect at all</emphasis>!</para>

          <para>After the restoration is over, click on the "remove the
          installation directory" link to remove the installation directory
          from your new host and begin using your site. If that is not
          possible or throws an error, please use your favourite FTP client
          (e.g. FileZilla) to manually remove the installation directory and
          all of its contents from your new host. Please do not ask for
          support if trying to access your site is causing the installation
          script to appear again. The solution is to remove the installation
          directory manually.</para>

          <para>If, after the restoration, you have any problems accessing the
          remote site, please refer to <link

          <para>Sometimes your site grows beyond Joomla!. A forum, a torrent
          tracker, a custom script... Some of them get to be installed in a
          database of their own, not as tables in the same database as the one
          Joomla! is using. If you really want to take a full site backup, you
          really need these databases backed up as well. The solution to this
          is the <guisubmenu>Multiple databases definitions</guisubmenu>
          option of <application>Akeeba Backup</application>. You can define
          an unlimited number of additional MySQL databases which will get to
          be backed up (and restored!) along with your regular Joomla!
          database.</para>

          <warning>

          <warning>

            <para>A common misconception is that if you want to also backup a

          to avoid directory name clashes. We call this folder the "virtual
          folder", because it doesn't physically exist on the server, it only
          exists inside the backup archive.</para>

          <para>For example, if you want to backup an off-site directory named
          <filename>images</filename> , if we weren't using the virtual folder
          it's contents would end up being backed up (and subsequently
          restored!) inside the Joomla! <filename>images</filename> directory.
          This is something you'd like to happen. If your virtual folder is
          called <filename>my_offsite_includes</filename> , this directory
          would end up being backed up as something like
          <filename>my_offsite_includes\1-images</filename> . Notice the
          number and the dash before the actual directory name? This is a
          smart feature which allows you to backup many directories of the
          same name. You could, for instance, backup two directories named
          <filename>images</filename> , confident that there would be no name
          clash inside the archive.</para>

          <para>Since keeping track of these folders is a pain,
          <application>Akeeba Backup</application> includes a
          <filename>readme.txt</filename> text file inside the virtual folder
          which tells you which backed up folder corresponds to which physical
          folder, making it easy for you to restore these directories to their
          rightful place.</para>

          <important>
            <para><application>Akeeba Backup</application> <emphasis>will
            not</emphasis> automatically restore the off-site directories to
            their original location. Since <application>Akeeba
            Backup</application> is meant for backing up, restoring and
            <emphasis>migrating</emphasis> sites to another host we chose not
            to automatically restore off-site directories, as this would break
            the migration process. A future version of <application>Akeeba
            Backup</application> might address this issue more elegantly. We
            are open to suggestions!</para>

        <para>More often than not you have data on your site you don't want to
        include in the backup set. This can be host-specific directories (e.g.
        <filename>cgi-bin</filename>, <filename>stats</filename>, etc), log
        files, temporary data, an huge but immutable collection of large media
        files, click tracking tables, download log database records and so
        forth. The exclusion filters allow you to fine tune what should be
        left out of the backup set.</para>

        <section xml:id="files-and-directories-exclusion">
          <title>Files and Directories Exclusion</title>

          <para>Ever had a file in your site's root put there by your host? Or
          how about that 200Mb video file in the media directory you don't
          want to backup? If you need to exclude just a few files here and
          there but let the other files in the directory be backed up, you can
          use this filter. Or, let's say you have a downloads folder with a
          size of 10Gb you don't want to backup every time. Or, maybe, your
          host saves Apache logs in your site's root so that they can be
          accessible by the provided analyser script. Possibly, you have
          another script (for example, a forum, a torrent tracker, you name
          it) in a subdirectory of your site's root - or even buried deeper in
          the directory structure - that you don't want to backup. Anyway, you
          need to exclude the contents of a directory from your backup. The
          Files and Directories Exclusion filters are just right for
          you.</para>

          <para>Before we begin our discussion regarding the operation mode of
          this filter, you have to know some automatic filters put in place by
          <application>Akeeba Backup</application>. It will automatically
          exclude your site's temp-folder, the "cache" directory on your
          site's root as well as all files and directories inside the
          component's output directory. This means that you should <emphasis
          role="bold">never, ever use a folder whose contents you want to
          backup as your output directory</emphasis>.</para>

              <para>The <guilabel>Root Directory</guilabel> drop-down menu.
              <application>Akeeba Backup</application> can define filters for
              the site's files or for each of the off-site directories
              separately. The default selection, [SITEROOT], contains all
              filters pertaining to the main site's files. If you have defined
              off-site directories, you can select the appropriate directory
              from the drop-down list in order to define filters for that
              directory.</para>

          <para>The lower area consists of two panes. Each pane contains rows

          off states by clicking on the icon. The force enabled state means
          that this exclusion type is active (on) and forcibly enabled by
          another feature of <application>Akeeba Backup</application>, such as

          <para>Sometimes you can have multiple sites installed in the same
          database, a common situation with sub-domains on cheap hosts who
          allow only one MySQL database per account. Some other times you have

          of your site and it has created tables in your site's database. Now
          it is possible to exclude these tables using the

              doesn't begin with your site's prefix. These are usually tables
              which do not belong to the current Joomla! installation.
              However, be warned of the major pitfall! If you host many

          <para>The lower area consists of a single pane, showing the contents
          of the database: tables, views, triggers, stored procedures and
          functions. Each row represents one database entity and consists of
          icons and text. The two leftmost icons represent an exclusion type
          and can have three states: on (yellow background), off (white
          background), or force enabled (red background). You can toggle
          between the on and off states by clicking on the icon. The force
          enabled state means that this exclusion type is active (on) and
          forcibly enabled by another feature of <application>Akeeba
          Backup</application>, such as regular expressions filters or simply
          denote that a specific filter is not applicable to this entity. For
          example, there is no point skipping dumping the data of a view, or a
          stored procedure, as they have no data in the sense a table does.
          The third icon, next to the database entity's name, represents the
          type of the entity, e.g. table, view, etc. You can hover your mouse
          over the icon to get a tooltip describing the kind of this
          entity.</para>

          <para>In our quest to provide the optimal feature set for web

          includes the Extension Filters feature. Using it you can exclude any
          <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> extension (component, module,
          plug-in, language or template) from the backup set, as if it was
          never installed! This allows web professionals to have a single
          "template site", where every common extension is installed. Creating
          a new site's skeleton is as easy as taking a backup with a different
          exclusion set. The benefit is that instead of maintaining multiple
          "template sites" - having to update <trademark>Joomla!</trademark>
          and the installed extensions on every issued update - you only have
          to manage one master installation. It's sheer efficiency!</para>

          <para>When you use this feature, <application>Akeeba Backup
          Professional</application> will automatically exclude the
          extension's files and/or directories, as well as any database
          entries pointing to it, effectively "cleaning" the backup from any
          traces of the extension.</para>

          <note>
            <para>This feature is available only in Akeeba Backup
            Professional, the paid version of our component</para>
          </note>

          <para>Sometimes you know that you have to exclude files or
          directories following a specific naming pattern, but they are so
          many that it's completely impractical going to the normal exclusion
          filters page and click them one by one. Or they are scattered around
          the file system tree, making it extremely complex to track them down
          and exclude them. Wouldn't it be nice to have an automated way to
          say, for example, "exclude all SVN directories from the backup"?
          Enter regular expressions. What are those regular expressions? Let's
          see what Wikipedia has to say on the subject:</para>

          <blockquote>
            <attribution><link
            xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression"
            xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">"Regular expression"
            article</link> from Wikipedia</attribution>

            <para>In computing, regular expressions, also referred to as regex
            or regexp, provide a concise and flexible means for matching
            strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns
            of characters. A regular expression is written in a formal
            language that can be interpreted by a regular expression
            processor, a program that either serves as a parser generator or
            examines text and identifies parts that match the provided
            specification.</para>
          </blockquote>

          <para>In a nutshell, regular expressions allow you to quickly define
          filters which span multiple subdirectories and match file or
          directory names based on a number of criteria. If you want a quick
          cheatsheet you can use, I suggest the <link
          xlink:href="http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet/"
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Regular Expressions Cheat
          Sheet (V2)</link> from AddedBytes.com. Some practical examples will
          be presented at the end of this section.</para>

          <para>There are some special considerations experienced regular
          expressions users must have in mind:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>You are supposed to specify a full regular expression,
              including its opening and ending separators. So "^foo" is
              invalid, but "/^foo/" and "#^foo#" are valid.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Akeeba Backup supports an extension to the PCRE syntax. If
              you prefix the regex with an exclamation mark you negate its
              meaning. So "/^foo/" will match all entities starting with
              "foo", whereas "!/^foo/" will match all entities NOT starting
              with "foo".</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Akeeba Backup stores and parses your data as raw Unicode
              (UTF-8), provided that your database meets the minimum
              requirement of MySQL 4.1 or greater. This eliminates the need to
              use the u suffix of regular expressions in order to reference
              Unicode characters.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>When it comes to files and directories exclusion filters in
          particular, you have to bear in mind:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>The path separator is always the forward slash, even on
              Windows. This means that c:\wamp\www\index.php is internally
              represented as c:/wamp/www/index.php. Therefore, all regular
              expressions must use the forward slash whenever referencing a
              path separator.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The filenames are always relative to the root. That's why
              you have to select a root before entering a regex filter. For
              instance, the images/stories directory on the root of your
              <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> site is internally referenced as
              "images/stories". You have to take this into account when
              writing regular expressions.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          you can find the <guilabel>Root Directory</guilabel> drop-down menu.
          <application>Akeeba Backup</application> can define filters for the
          site's files or for each of the off-site directories separately. The

          the main site's files. If you have defined off-site directories, you
          can select the appropriate directory from the drop-down list in

          </note>

          <para>Sometimes you know that you have to exclude database tables
          which follow a specific naming pattern, but they are so many that
          it's completely impractical going to the normal exclusion filters
          page and click them one by one. Or you want to exclude everything
          which doesn't match a specific pattern (e.g. it's not part of the
          site's main database), but the matching set dynamically and
          constantly changes over time, making it impossible to create an
          accurate filter without lots of maintenance. Enter regular
          expressions. What are those regular expressions? Let's see what
          Wikipedia has to say on the subject:</para>

          <blockquote>
            <attribution><link
            xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression"
            xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">"Regular expression"
            article</link> from Wikipedia</attribution>

            <para>In computing, regular expressions, also referred to as regex
            or regexp, provide a concise and flexible means for matching
            strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns
            of characters. A regular expression is written in a formal
            language that can be interpreted by a regular expression
            processor, a program that either serves as a parser generator or
            examines text and identifies parts that match the provided
            specification.</para>
          </blockquote>

          <para>In a nutshell, regular expressions allow you to quickly define
          filters which match table names based on a number of criteria. If
          you want a quick cheatsheet you can use, I suggest the <link
          xlink:href="http://www.addedbytes.com/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions-cheat-sheet/"
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Regular Expressions Cheat
          Sheet (V2)</link> from AddedBytes.com. Some practical examples will
          be presented at the end of this section.</para>

          <para>There are some special considerations experienced regular
          expressions users must have in mind:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>You are supposed to specify a full regular expression,
              including its opening and ending separators. So "^foo" is
              invalid, but "/^foo/" and "#^foo#" are valid.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Akeeba Backup supports an extension to the PCRE syntax. If
              you prefix the regex with an exclamation mark you negate its
              meaning. So "/^foo/" will match all entities starting with
              "foo", whereas "!/^foo/" will match all entities NOT starting
              with "foo".</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Akeeba Backup stores and parses your data as raw Unicode
              (UTF-8), provided that your database meets the minimum
              requirement of MySQL 4.1 or greater. This eliminates the need to
              use the u suffix of regular expressions in order to reference
              Unicode characters.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>When it comes to database table filters in particular, you
          have to bear in mind:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>All <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> tables have their
              prefix stripped and replaced by the standard <code>#__</code>
              placeholder. So, if your database prefix is <code>jos_</code>,
              <code>jos_users</code> is internally referenced as
              <code>#__users</code>. You must take this into account when
              writing regex filters, as this is the name you will have to
              match!</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The prefix replacement <emphasis>is not</emphasis> made in
              Database Only backup modes (either main site database, or all
              databases). As a result, you have to reference the tables by
              their full, normal name, e.g. <code>jos_users</code>.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The examples at the end of this section apply to a full
              site backup scenario, where the replacement does take
              place.</para>

          <title>Front-end backup, for use with CRON</title>

          <tip>
            <para>This option is available in both the Akeeba Backup Core and
            Akeeba Backup Professional releases. You don't need to subscribe
            to the Professional edition to use it.</para>
          </tip>

          <para>The front-end backup feature is intended to provide the
          capability to perform an unattended, scheduled backup of your
          site.</para>

          <para>The front-end backup URL performs a single backup step and
          sends a redirection (HTTP 302) header to force the client to advance
          to the next page, which performs the next step and so forth. You
          will only see a message upon completion, should it be successful or
          not. There are a few limitations, though:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis role="bold">It is not designed to be run from a
              normal web browser</emphasis>, but from an unattended cron
              script, utilizing <command>wget</command> or
              <command>cron</command> as a means of accessing the
              function.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The script is not capable of showing progress
              messages.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Normal web browsers tend to be "impatient". If a web page
              returns a bunch of redirection headers, the web browser thinks
              that the web server has had some sort of malfunction and stop
              loading the page. It will also show some kind of "destination
              unreachable" message. Remember, these browsers are meant to be
              used on web pages which are supposed to show some content to a
              human. This behaviour is normal. Most browsers will quit after
              they encounter the twentieth page redirect response, which is
              bound to happen. Do not come to the Free Support Forum
              complaining that Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari,
              Opera or another browser doesn't work with the front-end backup
              feature. It was NOT meant to work by design.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Command line utilities, by default, will also give up
              loading a page after it has been redirected a number of times.
              For example, <command>wget</command> gives up after 20
              redirects, <command>curl</command> does so after 50 redirects.
              Since <application>Akeeba Backup</application> redirects once
              for every step, it is advisable to configure your command line
              utility with a large number of redirects; about 10000 should be
              more than enough for virtually all sites.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>Do you want to automate your backups despite your host not
            supporting CRON? <link xlink:href="http://webcron.org/"
            xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Webcron.org</link>
            fully supports Akeeba Backup's front-end backup feature and is
            dirt cheap - you need to spend about 1 Euro for 1000 backup runs.
            Just make sure you set up your Webcron CRON job time limit to be
            at least 10% more than the time it takes for Akeeba Backup to
            backup your site. Don't know how much is that? No problem! Just
            take a regular backup from your site's back-end, then go to
            Administer Backup Files page and take a look at the Duration
            column. That's what you're looking for!</para>
          </tip>

          <para>Before beginning to use this feature, you must set up Akeeba
          Backup to support the front-end backup option. First, go to Akeeba
          Backup's main page and click on the <guibutton>Component
          Parameters</guibutton> button. Find the option titled
          <guilabel>Enable front-end and remote backup</guilabel> and set it
          to <option>Yes</option>. Below it, you will find the option named
          <guilabel>Secret key</guilabel>. In that box you have to enter a
          password which will allow your CRON job to convince Akeeba Backup
          that it has the right to request a backup to be taken. Think of it
          as the password required to enter the VIP area of a night club.
          After you're done, click the Save button on top to save the settings
          and close the dialog.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>Use only lower- and upper-case alphanumeric characters (0-9,
            a-z, A-Z) in your secret key. Other characters may need to be
            manually URL-encoded in the CRON job's command line. This is error
            prone and can cause the backup to never start even though you'll
            be quite sure that you have done everything correctly.</para>
          </tip>

          <para>Most hosts offer a CPanel of some kind. There has to be a
          section for something like "<guilabel>CRON Jobs</guilabel>",
          "<guilabel>scheduled tasks</guilabel>" and the like. The help screen
          in there describes how to set up a scheduled job. One missing part
          for you would be the command to issue. Simply putting the URL in
          there is not going to work.</para>

          <warning>
            <para>If your host only supports entering a URL in their "CRON"
            feature, this will most likely not work with <application>Akeeba
            Backup</application>. There is no workaround. It is a hard
            limitation imposed by your host. We would like to help you, but we
            can't. As always, the only barrier to the different ways we can
            help you is server configuration.</para>
          </warning>

          <para>If you are on a UNIX-style OS host (usually, a Linux host) you
          most probably have access to a command line utility called
          <command>wget</command>. It's almost trivial to use:</para>

          <para><command>wget --max-redirect=10000
          "http://<replaceable>www.yoursite.com</replaceable>/index.php?option=com_akeeba&amp;</command></para>

          <para><command>view=backup&amp;key=<replaceable>YourSecretKey</replaceable>"</command></para>

          <para>Of course, the line breaks are included for formatting clarity
          only. You should not have a line break in your command line!</para>

          <important>
            <para>Do not miss the <command>--max-redirect=1000</command> part
            of the <command>wget</command> command! If you fail to include it,
            the backup will not work with <command>wget</command> complaining
            that the maximum number of redirections has been reached. This is
            normal behavior, it is not a bug.</para>
          </important>

          <warning>
            <para>Do not forget to surround the URL in double quotes. If you
            don't the backup will fail and it will be your fault! The reason
            is that the ampersand is also used to separate multiple commands
            in a single command line. If you don't use the double quotes at
            the start and end of the backup URL, your host will think that you
            tried to run multiple commands and load your site's homepage
            instead of the front-end backup URL.</para>
          </warning>

          <para>If you're unsure, check with your host. Sometimes you have to
          get from them the full path to wget in order for CRON to work, thus
          turning the above command line to something like:</para>

          <para><command>/usr/bin/wget --max-redirect=10000
          "http://<replaceable>www.yoursite.com</replaceable>/index.php?option=com_akeeba&amp;</command></para>

          <para><command>view=backup&amp;key=<replaceable>YourSecretKey</replaceable>"</command></para>

          <para>Contact your host; they usually have a nifty help page for all
          this stuff. Read also the section on CRON jobs below.</para>

          <para>Optionaly, you can also include an extra parameter to the
          above URL, <uri>&amp;id=</uri><replaceable>profile_id</replaceable>,
          where <replaceable>profile_id</replaceable> is the numeric ID of the
          profile you want to use for the backup. If you don't specify this
          parameter, the default backup profile (ID=1) will be used. In this
          sense, the aforementioned URL becomes:</para>

          <para><command>/usr/bin/wget --max-redirect=10000
          "http://<replaceable>www.yoursite.com</replaceable>/index.php?option=com_akeeba&amp;</command></para>

          <para><command>view=backup&amp;key=<replaceable>YourSecretKey</replaceable>&amp;profile=<replaceable>profile_id</replaceable>"</command></para>

          <para><systemitem>wget</systemitem> is multi-platform command line
          utility program which is not included with all operating systems. If
          your system does not include the <systemitem>wget</systemitem>
          command, it can be downloaded at this address: <link

          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html</link>.
          Please note that the option <option>--max-redirect</option> is
          available on <systemitem>wget</systemitem> version 1.11 and
          above.</para>

          <important>
            <para>Using a web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, ...) or
            <systemitem>wget</systemitem> version 1.10 and earlier will most
            probably result into an error message concerning the maximum
            redirections limit being exceeded. This is
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> a bug. Most network software will stop
            dealing with a web site after it has redirected the request more
            than 20 times. This is a safety feature to avoid consuming network
            resources on misconfigured web sites which have entered an
            infinite redirection loop. <application>Akeeba
            Backup</application> uses redirections creatively, to force the
            continuation of the backup process without the need for
            client-side scripting. It is possible, depending on site size,
            <application>Akeeba Backup</application> configuration and server
            setup, that it will exceed the limit of 20 redirections while
            performing a backup operation.</para>

            occur. This is not a bug, it's the way wget works.</para>

            <para>As user DrChalta pointed out in a forum post, there is an

            <title>Overriding configuration variables</title>

            <para>Since Akeeba Backup 3.1 the Native CRON Script allows you to
            override or supply missing configuration variables in the command
            line. This is especially useful for security reasons. One security
            issue with the cloud storage service integration is that other
            administrators can peek at Akeeba Backup's configuration and read
            the username, password or API keys used to access the cloud
            storage service. You can, however, leave these fields blank in the
            configuration and supply their values in the command line.</para>

            <para>Overriding a configuration variable requires knowing its key
            name. The key names are represented in dot-format, i.e.
            <option>engine.postproc.dropbox.email</option> for DropBox's email
            field. Determining the key name is quite easy, as they are stored
            in INI files throughout the component's back-end. The first
            location you should look at is
            <filename>administrator/components/com_akeeba/akeeba/core</filename>,
            where you will find four INI files with general settings. Inside
            the
            <filename>administrator/components/com_akeeba/akeeba/engines</filename>
            and
            <filename>administrator/components/com_akeeba/akeeba/plugins/engines</filename>
            directories and their subdirectories you will find one INI file
            per engine.</para>

            <para>In order to save you from trouble, here are the most useful
            key names for providing cloud storage engine credentials. The
            names are designed to be self-explanatory.</para>

-override "engine.postproc.dropbox.email=foobar@example.com"
-override "engine.postproc.dropbox.password=VerySecretPassword"</programlisting>

            <para>In this case, we are telling the backup script to use the
            backup Profile with ID=2, give the backup description of "My

            password.</para>

            <important>
              <para>The values of the override parameters MUST be enclosed in

              back to the backup.php script.</para>
            </important>

            <para>Finally, it should be noted that you can use the
            command-line override feature to do more tricky configuration
            overrides, for example turning off the archive splitting or using
            a different backup output directory to enhance your security. If
            it's something you can do in the Configuration page of the
            component, you can also do it using command line overrides.</para>

            edition to use it.</para>
          </tip>

          <para>On some hosts it is impossible to use the native CRON script
          outlined in the previous section. On such hosts the CRON script will
          get aborted if it is using too much CPU time, or if the system load
          exceeds a value predefined by your host company. In order to
          accomodate for these hosts, Akeeba Backup Professional includes an
          alternative CRON script. The alternative CRON script performs the
          backup by using the front-end backup feature of Akeeba Backup. The
          alternative CRON script is located in
          <filename>administrator/components/com_akeeba/altbackup.php</filename>,
          and must be run from the command-line PHP interface (PHP
          CLI).</para>

          <para>In order to schedule a backup, you will have to use the
          following command line to your host's CRON interface:</para>

          <para>where <replaceable>/usr/local/bin/php</replaceable> is the
          path to your PHP CLI executable and
          <replaceable>/home/USER/webroot</replaceable> is the absolute path
          to your web site's root. You can get this information from your

              being produced and without a backup entry being written to the

              allow the script to access the front-end backup URL. Do note
              that despite the alternative CRON script and your site running
              on the same server, the firewall restriction might still be in

        <title>Miscellaneous features</title>

        <para>Some features do not fall under any other category. We decided

        useful features.</para>

          <title>Lite mode for cell phones, PDAs, MIDs, etc.</title>

          <para>In contrast to the classic front-end backup which is meant
          primarily for backup automation, the "Light Mode" is meant for
          performing site backups from a browser, without even having to log
          in to the administrator backend. It goes further than that, enabling
          you to backup your site from any web-capable device, including
          Pocket PC's, netbooks, your iPod or even your cell phone!</para>

          <para>The "Light Mode" requires that your browser has at least
          rudimentary support for Javascript. Most recent web-capable devices,
          including low end cellphones, fulfill this requirement. This feature
          has been tested on Pocket Internet Explorer running on a Mio P560
          and a HTC Touch, as well as Sony Ericsson and Nokia mobile phones.
          We have tested it with mobile WebKit-based browsers, such as those
          supplied with Android phones and iPhones. It also works on devices
          running Opera Mobile.</para>

          <para>The "light mode" performs user authentication using the
          front-end backup's secret word and allows you to select the backup
          profile. It does not give you, however, the option to download your
          backup. If you want to do so, you'll either have to log in to the
          administrator back-end of your site, or use other means - e.g. FTP
          client software.</para>

          <para>In order to access the "Light Mode" you have to visit the
          URL:</para>

          <para><uri>http://<replaceable>www.example.com</replaceable>/index.php?option=com_akeeba&amp;view=light</uri></para>

          <para>Just replace <replaceable>www.example.com</replaceable> with

          <title>System Restore Points</title>

          <note>
            <para>This feature is only available in Akeeba Backup
            Professional, the for-a-fee edition of our software</para>
          </note>

          <para>Since Akeeba Backup 3.3.a1 we support an exciting new feature
          called System Restore Points. In order to let you understand what it
          is, let's start with a simple exercise.</para>

          <para>Imagine that you have a site on which you've spent countless
          hours configuring, say, a web shop component. One day you see that
          there is an update available. It's a minor update, so you decide to
          not take a backup (it takes several minutes, you're too impatient to
          wait for it) and go ahead with the update. Unfortunately, the update
          completely breaks your site. You try to re-install the previous
          version of your web shop component but, due to database changes, it
          no longer works. Your latest backup is from several weeks ago.
          You're stuck. You have to spend countless hours, all over again,
          losing sales in the meantime, to get your site working properly
          again.</para>

          <para>Wouldn't it be very cool if Joomla! was able to backup the
          extension you're upgrading (all of its files and data) when you are
          upgrading it? Wouldn't it be very cool if you could just roll back
          to the previous state of the component, from that automatic backup,
          with a single click? It sounds like science fiction. No other CMS
          does that. It must be impossible to do, right? WRONG! We present you
          our System Restore Point feature which does that and is available
          even in the free of charge Core release of our software. And it's
          fully compatible with Joomla! 1.5 and later versions, out of the
          box!</para>

          <bridgehead>How does it work?</bridgehead>

          <para>All you have to do is to enable the "System - System Restore
          Points" plugin which is installed with Akeeba Backup 3.3.a1 or
          later. By default, the plugin is automatically enabled when you
          install Akeeba Backup. This plugin allows us to intercept your
          interaction with Joomla!'s Extension Installer, providing our
          enhanced version without modifying your Joomla! core files.</para>

          <para>All you have to do is install a component upgrade, just like
          you always did. Our enhanced extensions installer will see that and
          before Joomla! installs it, Akeeba Backup will take a backup of the
          extension files and database contents. After that, the original
          Joomla! extensions installer will take care of the extension's
          installation. So simple!</para>

          <para>What if you don't want to take a System Restore Point? That's
          very simple as well. Just click on the <guilabel>Back to regular
          installer</guilabel> link on the bottom of the page to deactivate
          the System Restore Point temporarily, or unpublish the plugin to
          deactivate System Restore Points permanently.</para>

          <bridgehead>How do I restore a System Restore Point?</bridgehead>

          <para>Just go to Akeeba Backup, Administer Backup Files. You will
          see two links below the toolbar, <guilabel>Backups</guilabel> and
          <guilabel>Restore Points</guilabel>. Just click on <guilabel>Restore
          Points</guilabel> to see a list of all restore points. Select the
          one you want and click on <guibutton>Roll Back</guibutton>. That's
          all! Please read the next few paragraphs to understand the
          pitfalls.</para>

          <para>If you want to reclaim free space on your host, just select
          the restore points which are no longer relevant and click on
          <guibutton>Delete</guibutton>.</para>

          <bridgehead>Where are restore points stored?</bridgehead>

          <para>System Restore Point backup archives are always stored in the
          Output Directory of the default backup profile (profile #1). By
          default, that is
          <filename>administrator/components/com_akeeba/backup</filename>. You
          can change it by editing the default profile's configuration. All
          restore points are named <filename>restore-point-*.jpa</filename> to
          make it easier for you to find them with, say, an FTP client.</para>

          <bridgehead>How can I make my extension compatible with System
          Restore Points?</bridgehead>

          <para>All you have to do is to add a small snippet of XML inside
          your extension's XML manifest. We provide up-to-date documentation
          for developers in <link
          xlink:href="https://www.akeebabackup.com/documentation/item/1127-system-restore-points.html"
          xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">a dedicated page on our
          site</link>. If you get stuck, do not hesitate to contact us, as
          instructed on the end of that page.</para>

          <bridgehead>The System Restore Points feature does not allow me to
          install a component / plugin / module / template. Now
          what?</bridgehead>

          <para>Not all extensions are compatible with the System Restore
          Points feature of Akeeba Backup. Some of them might fail to install
          at all when you're using SRP. In this case, you have two
          options:</para>

          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Temporarily disable SRP. In the extensions installer page,
              towards the bottom, you will see a link which reads "Back to the
              standard installer". Click on it. The page reloads and the
              bottom line with the Akeeba Backup logo is no longer there. Now
              retry installing your extension; it should work. If not, proceed
              to the next option.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Completely disable SRP. Go to Extensions, Plugin Manager
              and find the <guilabel>System - System Restore Points</guilabel>
              plugin. Disable it by clicking on the green checkmark (Joomla!
              1.5) or green hollow disk (Joomla! 1.6 and later) so that it
              turns red. This completely disables Akeeba Backup's SRP feature
              until you enable back the plugin.</para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>

          <bridgehead>I restored a System Restore Point and my component /
          plugin / module / template is still broken!</bridgehead>

          <para>As you read above, not all extensions are fully compatible
          with Akeeba Backup's System Restore Point feature. The following
          problems, outside our control, may arise:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis role="bold">Database tables not backed
              up</emphasis>. Akeeba Backup expects a specific naming
              convention for database table. For example, if you have
              com_foobar, it expects that its tables are named
              jos_foobar_something, where jos_ is your site's prefix and
              something is the last part of the table's name. Some components,
              however, do not follow that convention. For example, VirtueMart
              is called com_virtumart and its tables follow the
              jos_vm_something convention. Unless the extension's developer or
              us (as in the case of VirtueMart!) have provided an SRP
              integration file, Akeeba Backup's SRP feature will NOT back up
              the component's tables and restoring the SRP will pretty much
              make no difference, despite Akeeba Backup reporting that it was
              restored successfully. Unless Joomla! enforces a strict table
              naming standard, you can pretty much be sure that this will
              happen. The solution is to ALWAYS have a tested backup of your
              site and ALWAYS try extension upgrades on a dev or local copy of
              your site.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis role="bold">Related extensions not backed
              up</emphasis>. Many components rely on numerous plugins and
              modules to provide their functionality. Major components like
              K2, Tienda, VirtueMart, even Akeeba Backup itself, follow this
              approach. Unless its developer or us have provided an SRP
              integration file, Akeeba Backup doesn't know about this
              necessary related extensions, doesn't back them up and -of
              course- does not restore them. Due to that, even after an SRP
              restoration your component may still be broken! Unless Joomla!
              enforces a way to positively link related extensions to the
              component, you can pretty much be sure that this will happen.
              The solution is to ALWAYS have a tested backup of your site and
              ALWAYS try extension upgrades on a dev or local copy of your
              site.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para><emphasis role="bold">Added files are not
              removed</emphasis>. This may sound a little crazy, but it can be
              a huge problem. If the newer version of the component added
              files which were not present in the previous, backed up, version
              it is very possible that they will cause a problem. This depends
              on how the component works. Unfortunately, the only workaround
              is to uninstall the newer version, reinstall the old one and
              then restore your SRP backup.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Please note that SRP is a more or less experimental
          technology. We are trying to provide a feature that Joomla! wasn't
          designed to be capable of. As a result, this feature is prone to
          breakage. While we have tried our best to support the major
          components out of the box, we can't really support everything under
          the sun (not with 8,000 Joomla! extensions listed in the JED and
          growing). Do not rely solely on SRPs for the good health of your
          site. We recommend to ALWAYS take a full site backup prior to the
          installation / uninstallation / upgrade of any extension on your
          site and to ALWAYS test your backups. An untested backup is not a
          backup! Our Quick Start Guide provides important information
          regarding the ways to test your backups.</para>

        <para>The "Akeeba Backup Notification Module" is an administrator

        It's mission is rather simple: it checks the latest backup record and

        perform those checks as long as your site receives about ten visits
        every day at minimum.</para>

        <para>When a new version is detected, it will send an email to all
        Super Administrators on your site notifying you of the fact. But we go
        one step further than simply notifying you of the availability of the
        new version. Clicking on the link found in the update notification
        email you are automatically logged in to your site and forwarded to
        the Akeeba Backup's Live Update page, which starts installing the new
        version automatically (the link is valid only for 24 hours since the
        email was sent and can only be used <emphasis>once</emphasis>). So,
        basically, you click on a link and Akeeba Backup updates itself. One
        click updates are no longer science fiction!</para>

        <para>This feature is available in both Akeeba Backup Core and Akeeba
        Backup Professional and is fully compatible with Joomla! 1.5 and 1.6.
        The only prerequisite is that your site supports Akeeba Backup's Live
        Update feature. You can check this by visiting Akeeba Backup's Control
        Panel page. If it says that you already have the latest version or
        that an update is available, your server supports Live Update. If it
        says that "Live Update is not supported" then the one-click update
        will not work.</para>

        <bridgehead>Wow! That's awesome! I am a developer and would like to do
        the same thing for my components. Is it possible?</bridgehead>

        <para>Yes! It's all distributed under the GPLv3 and can be reused with
        any component/module/plugin/template using the same license. For
        starters, you can dissect the two plugins. It's very easy to figure
        out how they work. In fact, it's so darn simple that will make you
        wonder why this wasn't in use for decades already. If you have
        questions, contact us through our site's Contact Us page or by posting
        on our forum and we will help you. That's the spirit of Free and Open
        Source Software: spreading knowledge.</para>

          <para>These instructions are meant to be first read before disaster
          strikes. Therefore, a fair amount of humour has been used
          throughout. If you try to read it after disaster struck you will
          naturally find the humorous parts inappropriate, or even offensive.

        </note>

        <para>Inevitably, some people will end up with a backup file, a ruined
        site and a problem in the restoration procedure they can't work out.
        Almost always, the recipe includes a pressing deadline which requires
        that the site is on-line... yesterday. If you are in a situation like
        the one we just described, breathe. Do not panic. We've got you
        covered, with this concise manual site restoration guide. So, here it
        goes... it's manual Joomla! Site restoration In 7 steps or even
        less.</para>

        <para><bridgehead renderas="sect3">Step 1. Making sure it won't get
        worse.</bridgehead></para>

        <para>Assuming such a situation, it's only human to be in panic and
        despair. Panic is a bad counsellor. It will give you wrong advice.
        Despair will only make you careless. So, people, get it together! Make
        a backup of the only thing separating you from complete disaster: the
        backup file. Burn it on a CD. Write it on your USB key. Put it on a
        couple of locations on your file server. Just make sure you'll have an
        extra copy in case you screw up.</para>

        <para>This exercise has been proven to lower the probability of
        anything going wrong. Furthermore, it's good for your psychology. It
        gives you a sense of security you didn't have five minutes ago.</para>

        <bridgehead renderas="sect3">Step 2. Extracting the
        archive.</bridgehead>

        <para>Now, we have to extract the archive somewhere on your local hard
        drive.</para>

        <para>If the archive is of the JPA type, you'll have to use Akeeba
        eXtract Wizard, available without charge from our website.</para>

        <para>If you have a ZIP package, there are a couple of gotchas. If you
        are working on a Linux machine, unzip will work just fine. If you're
        on Windows and under certain configuration circumstances on the server
        you took the backup on, you might not be able to extract it with
        WinZIP, WinRAR, 7-Zip or other archiver software. So you'll have to
        use Akeeba eXtract Wizard available for free from our website. This is
        a GUI utility which allows direct extraction of backup archives on
        your <trademark>Windows</trademark> PC. It is possible to run it under
        other operating systems, such as <trademark>Mac OS X</trademark> and
        <trademark>Linux</trademark>, using DarWINE and WINE respectively.
        Please refer to the Akeeba eXtract Wizard documentation, available
        on-line on our site, for more information on using it.</para>

        <para><bridgehead renderas="sect3">Step 3. Editing your database
        backup.</bridgehead></para>

        <para>Take a look at the directory where you extracted your backup
        archive. Inside it there is a directory named
        <filename>installation</filename>. Inside this, there is a
        subdirectory named <filename>sql</filename>. Inside this there is a
        file, <filename>joomla.sql</filename>, containing your database data.
        <emphasis>COPY THIS TO ANOTHER LOCATION NOW!</emphasis> We'll have to
        edit it, so please, don't tamper with the original, will you?</para>

        <para>Open the copy of <filename>joomla.sql</filename>. Use a text
        editor (we recommend <application>gedit</application> and
        <application>Kate</application> on <trademark>Linux</trademark>,
        <application>Notepad++</application> on
        <trademark>Windows</trademark>; do not use
        <application>Wordpad</application> or
        <application>Word</application>!). If you were ever familiar with
        <acronym>SQL</acronym>, you'll recognize that each line consists of a
        single <acronym>SQL</acronym> command. But they have a problem: table
        names are mangled. You'll see that tables are in a form similar to
        <database>#__banner</database> instead of
        <database>jos_banner</database>. Ah, nice! We'll have to fix
        that.</para>

        <para>Using your text editors Replace command, do the following
        changes:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>search for <emphasis role="bold">CREATE TABLE
            `#__</emphasis> replace with <emphasis role="bold">CREATE TABLE
            `jos_</emphasis></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>search for <emphasis role="bold">DROP TABLE IF EXISTS
            `#__</emphasis> replace with <emphasis role="bold">DROP TABLE IF
            EXISTS `jos_</emphasis></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>search for <emphasis role="bold">INSERT INTO `#__</emphasis>
            replace with <emphasis role="bold">INSERT INTO
            `jos_</emphasis></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>search for <emphasis role="bold">CREATE VIEW `#__</emphasis>
            replace with <emphasis role="bold">CREATE VIEW
            `jos_</emphasis></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>search for <emphasis role="bold">CREATE PROCEDURE
            `#__</emphasis> replace with <emphasis role="bold">CREATE
            PROCEDURE `jos_</emphasis></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>search for <emphasis role="bold">CREATE FUNCTION
            `#__</emphasis> replace with <emphasis role="bold">CREATE FUNCTION
            `jos_</emphasis></para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>search for <emphasis role="bold">CREATE TRIGGER
            `#__</emphasis> replace with <emphasis role="bold">CREATE TRIGGER
            `jos_</emphasis></para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The idea is to replace all instances of <database>#__</database>
        (note that there are two underscores after the hash sign) with
        <database>jos_ in the MySQL command part (not the data
        part)</database>. DO NOT PERFORM A BLIND SEARCH AND REPLACE OF #__
        WITH jos_ AS IT WILL CAUSE SEVERE PROBLEMS WITH SOME COMPONENTS. Easy,
        wasn't it? <emphasis>NOW SAVE THAT FILE</emphasis>!</para>

        <bridgehead renderas="sect3">Step 4. Restoring the
        database.</bridgehead>

        <para>In order to restore the database on the server you'll have to
        use some appropriate tool. For small to moderately sized database
        dumps (up to 2Mb), we find that <application><link
        xlink:href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net"
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">phpMyAdmin</link></application>
        does the trick pretty well, plus it's installed on virtually all PHP
        enabled commercial hosts. For larger dumps, we found that <link
        xlink:href="http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump.php"
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><application>bigdump.php</application>
        from Alexey Ozerov</link> works wonders. Use either of those tools -
        or any other of your liking - to restore your database.</para>

        <para>If the restoration gets stuck with SQL errors on some CREATE
        TABLE command, it seems that you are restoring to a server with an
        older MySQL version than the one you took the backup from. In this
        case, if you have still access to the original site, you can perform a
        new Akeeba Backup backup with the database compatibility mode set to
        MySQL 4 and start over. You did read the User Guide section on
        configuration options, right?</para>

        <para>If you don't have access to the original site... Oh, this is
        gonna be such a long night. In a nutshell, you have two options: a)
        Edit all of the CREATE TABLE commands, eliminating everything between
        the last parenthesis and the semi-colon of each command. b) Set up a
        MySQL 5 enabled local server (for example, XAMPP, WAMP, LAMPP, MAMP,
        depending on your operating system), restore the site in there, take a
        backup with the database compatibility mode set to MySQL 4 and start
        over.</para>

        <bridgehead renderas="sect3">Step 5. Upload your site's
        files.</bridgehead>

        <para>First of all, delete the installation subdirectory from the
        directory you extracted the backup archive to. We won't be needing
        this any more. Then, using FTP - or any method you please - upload all
        of the files to the target server.</para>

        <para>If you want to be thorough remember to set the directory and
        file permissions accordingly. If you just want to get the damn thing
        on-line ASAP, just skip this permissions thing; it will remind you of
        itself as soon as you try to do some website administration (like
        uploading a picture) after the site's back on-line.</para>

        <bridgehead renderas="sect3">Step 6. Edit configuration.php, if
        necessary.</bridgehead>

        <para>If you were restoring to the same server location you took the
        backup on, nothing else is necessary. Your site should be back on-line
        now. If not, you'll have to edit the
        <filename>configuration.php</filename>.</para>

        <para>You have Joomla! 1.5.x. Good news! Joomla! 1.5.x doesn't require
        you to specify some of the hard-to-obtain parameters. Your
        <filename>configuration.php</filename> consists of several lines. Each
        one is in the following form:</para>

        <para><code>var $key = "value";</code></para>

        <para>The key is the name of the configuration variable and value
        (inside double quotes!) is the value of the variable. Below we provide
        a list of the configuration variables which have to be modified to get
        up on-line.</para>

            <term>dbtype</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>is the database driver Joomla! will use. It can be either
              mysql or mysqli (notice the extra i in the end). If unsure, your
              best bet is mysql.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>is the database prefix; if you followed our instructions,

              Joomla! site's front page looks as if all images and CSS files
              are not loading, you have to modify it and enter your site's
              base URL. For example, if the new site is located in
              <uri>http://www.example.com/mysite/</uri>, you have to locate
              the line starting with <code>var $live_site</code> and change it
              to become:</para>

              <para><code>var $live_site =
              "http://www.example.com/mysite";</code></para>

        <section xml:id="how-to-cloud-backup-intro">
          <title>Introduction</title>

          <para>For most of us, our websites are a key element to our
          business. Either being the business itself, or acting as the
          storefront to the Internet, they provide a significant added value.
          The last thing any web site owner want is to see their site defaced,
          damaged or even lost. Dangers lurk everywhere. From a simple human
          error in site administration to malicious activity and from hardware
          failure to natural disasters, no web server is the bulletproof vault
          we’d like it to be.</para>

          <para>While nobody expects a catastrophe to hit his site, a good
          deal of precaution is required. It's pretty much the same rationale
          as in wearing a seatbelt while driving; you don't expect to crash,
          but if you do you most certainly want to evade the incident
          unharmed. The web site equivalent to a safety belt is none other
          than backup.</para>

          <para>Web site backup comes with its own set of limitations and
          pitfalls. If you trust your web host for backup you might find your
          expectations fall short. Most hosts take daily backups – if any at
          all –on a secondary hard disk on the same server or, even worse, on
          a secondary partition of the same hard disk. If the server goes down
          due to a hardware fault, so does your backup. A few enlightened
          hosts also take backups on remote storage, for example NAS arrays.
          Even they do so on rather sparse intervals, for example twice per
          week. This means that on a complete catastrophe you will most
          assuredly lose a fair amount of data.</para>

          <para>The solution is simple in concept. Take your own backups and
          store them on a cloud storage service, like Amazon S3 or even
          DropBox. Taking your own backups means that you get to decide which
          data and how often has to be backed up, making sure that the
          crucial, regularly updated information routinely ends up in a backup
          archive. Using a cloud storage device adds a strong data safety
          clause to your procedure, while keeping costs low. Cloud storage is
          designed to be redundant and reliable, boasting a negligible risk of
          data corruption or data loss. Combined with its incredibly low cost
          (or even no cost for very low storage requirements!), it is

          <para>This section describes how to set up your site to store its
          backup archives to either Amazon S3 or DropBox. More cloud storage

          the <guilabel>Archiver Engine</guilabel> setting in the pane titled
          <guilabel>Advanced Configuration</guilabel>. Click the button
          labeled <guibutton>Configure…</guibutton> next to it in order for
          the detailed settings to display. You should get something like
          this:</para>

          type in 20 in the text box that appears to the right of the
          drop-down. This setting will chunk our backup archive into multiple
          files, the maximum size of each one being the value of this
          setting.</para>

          <para>You might wonder why we need to do that. PHP always has a
          strict time limit, i.e. the maximum time a PHP page may process data
          before the web server aborts it. Uploading the backup archives to
          cloud storage takes time, the exact amount of which depends on the
          size of the file and the network speed. The time limit and the
          bandwidth are beyond our control, so we can change the only
          parameter we can touch in order to avoid timeouts: the file size.
          <application>Akeeba Backup Professional</application> is smart
          enough to upload each part of the backup archive on a PHP page load
          of each own, so as to avoid timing out.</para>

          <para>In this configuration details pane you have to enter your
          Amazon S3 <guilabel>Access key</guilabel> and <guilabel>Private
          key</guilabel>. You should have been given those keys during your
          signup to Amazon S3. If you haven't noted them down, just sign in to
          your Amazon S3 account and go to the <guilabel>Security
          Credentials</guilabel> page. You will find this information in the
          <guilabel>Access Keys</guilabel> section. Back to our configuration
          page, checking the <guilabel>Use SSL</guilabel> setting will make
          your data transfer over a secure, encrypted connection at the price
          of taking a little longer to process. I recommend turning it on
          anyway. The <guilabel>Bucket</guilabel> setting defines the Amazon
          S3 bucket you are going to use to store your backup into. The
          <guilabel>Directory</guilabel> defines a directory inside the bucket
          where you want the backup files stored and must have been already
          created.</para>

          <para>Do note that as per S3 standards the path separator for the
          directory is the forward slash. For example, writing
          <filename>first_level\second_level</filename> is wrong, whereas
          <filename>first_level/second_level</filename> is the correct form. I
          recommend using one bucket for nothing but site backups, with one
          directory per site or subdomain you intend to backup. If you want to
          use a first-level directory, just type in its name without a
          trailing or leading forward slash.</para>

          timeout bar – the bar which looks like a progress bar – fills all

          have to go back to the configuration and lower the <guilabel>Part

          <important>
            <para>On local testing servers you will have to use ridiculously
            small part sizes, in the area of 1-5Mb, as the xDSL consumer

            <para>If you get a RequestTimeout warning while Akeeba Backup is

            the Configuration engine and enable the "Disable multipart

            will not work. You will also have to use a relatively small part

            <para>In this example, we have created a bucket for all site

            subfolder. Also the credentials can only add backups. Backups can
            not be deleted or even downloaded. The only access the credential
            has is "PutObject" to upload the backup file. Here is the sample
            policy file (L:\IAMCli-1.2.0\policy\MYSITE-backup.txt):</para>

            <para>That's it! Now you can use those S3 credentials in your
            Akeeba Backup profile.</para>

            <bridgehead>Using a third party application</bridgehead>

            <para>In this example, we will use Cloudberry S3 Explorer Pro
            which has an "Access Manager" function that make this process very
            easy. There is a 15 day free trial you can use to set this all up.
            The full version costs about $39.</para>

            <para>You can create as many groups as you want and easily create
            policies for each group. Just create a group and policy for each
            subdirectory in your S3 bucket. Each subdirectory is supposed to
            contain backups of a single website. Then create a user to put in
            each group. Once that is done you can right click on the user and
            select "Manage Access Keys". That will give you the S3 Access keys
            you need to enter into your Akeeba Backup profile.</para>

            <para>The only gotcha is that when you create the policy and are
            browsing for the bucket and directory to apply the "PutObject"
            rights to, it doesn't add the "/*" at the end that is needed to
            make this work. You have to specify the resource and then go back
            and edit it so you can add the slash and star.</para>

            <bridgehead>Further thoughts</bridgehead>

            <para>Giving a user only the PutObject privilege allows the user
            to upload backups to the bucket, but any remote quotas will fail,
            as the user is not allowed to delete any objects (files) in your
            S3 bucket. You can opt for a compromise between tight security and
            ease of use. If you give your user both the PutObject and
            DeleteObject privileges he will be able to upload backups
            (PutObject) and run quotas (DeleteObject) but not list or download
            backup archives. In other words, even in the unlikely event that
            an attacker gains complete access to your site's database
            <emphasis>and</emphasis> filesystem, recovers the encrypted
            contents of Akeeba Backup's configuration table and encryption key
            file, writes a script to decode the configuration, gets access to
            your S3 credentials and tries to use them, he won't be able to
            download backup archives or even use those S3 credentials with any
            graphical S3 tool.</para>

          <title>Using DropBox</title>

          <para>Under some circumstances using a for-a-fee cloud storage
          service may be beyond the budget of the client, as is usually the
          case with personal or very small business websites. DropBox offers
          an inexpensive storage service, giving out the first 2 Gb of storage
          for free. Moreover, they offer a desktop client application which
          synchronizes the files stored in the cloud with those stored locally
          on a specified directory. Within the scope of backup, this is a very
          desirable feature, as it allows for automatic redundant storage of
          the backup archives on the local PC (actually, on any number of
          local PCs!), without any manual intervention.</para>

          <para>To this end, we decided to include a preliminary support for
          DropBox storage. We call this preliminary because there is no formal
          API published for DropBox yet. What we use is a workaround solution
          which transparently signs in the DropBox.com web site and submits
          each backup archive part to the file upload form located in there.
          This means that if DropBox decides to change the layout of their
          site, this solution might stop working - although we have strong
          reasons to believe that this is highly unlikely.</para>

          <para>If you've followed the instructions so far, it's DropBox setup
          time! In the <guilabel>Configuration</guilabel> page, right below
          the <guilabel>Archiver Engine</guilabel> setting there's another
          setting called <guilabel>Data processing engine</guilabel>. Use the
          drop-down to select the <guilabel>Upload to DropBox</guilabel> value
          and then click the button titled <guibutton>Configure…</guibutton>
          next to it. You should now see something like this:</para>

          <para>In this configuration details pane you have to enter your
          DropBox.com <guilabel>email</guilabel> and
          <guilabel>password</guilabel>. You should have been given those keys
          during your signup to DropBox.com. They are the same you use to sign
          in to your DropBox.com account. The <guilabel>Directory</guilabel>
          defines a directory inside your DropBox account where you want the
          backup files stored and must have been already created.</para>

          <para>Do note that as per DropBox.com standards the path separator
          for the directory is the forward slash. For example, writing
          <filename>first_level\second_level</filename> is wrong, whereas
          <filename>first_level/second_level</filename> is the correct form. I
          recommend using one directory for nothing but site backups, with one
          subdirectory per site or subdomain you intend to backup. If you want
          to use a first-level directory, just type in its name without a
          trailing or leading forward slash.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>If you have installed DropBox' desktop client application on
            your PC you can simply create the directory on your local DropBox
            directory (usually found under My Documents in
            <trademark>Windows</trademark> machines). The desktop client
            application will automatically synchronize the folders to your
            on-line account.</para>
          </tip>

          <para>Enough said. Click on <guibutton>Save</guibutton> to store the
          changed settings. Back to the <application>Akeeba Backup
          Professional</application> Control Panel, click on the
          <guibutton>Backup Now</guibutton> icon. It's backup time!</para>

          <para>Ignore any warning about the <guilabel>Default output
          directory in use</guilabel>. We don't need to care about it; our
          backup archives will end up securely stored on DropBox anyway. Just
          click on the big <guibutton>Backup Now!</guibutton> button and sit
          back. The upload to DropBox takes place in the final step of the
          process, titled <guilabel>Finalizing the backup process</guilabel>.
          If during this stage you observe that the timeout bar – the bar
          which looks like a progress bar – fills all the way to the right,
          you have a timeout error. This means that you have to go back to the
          configuration and lower the <guilabel>Part size for archive
          splitting</guilabel> setting.</para>

          <important>
            <para>On local testing servers you will have to use ridiculously
            small part sizes, in the area of 1-5Mb, as the xDSL consumer
            Internet service has a much more limited bandwidth than your
            host.</para>

          <para>Backing up your site to the cloud is the first step to backup
          autonomy and data safety. However, you still have to login to your
          site's back-end to take a cloud backup. This is suboptimal. What
          about when you are on the road for days, without reliable Internet
          connection? What about not wanting to go through this daily
          drill?</para>

          <para>I am 100% behind you on this. I don't like routine either. You
          know, programmers are lazy and get bored easily.</para>

          <para>With <application>Akeeba Backup Professional</application> you
          have three (that's not a typo, three) different options to automate
          your backup! Two of them are designed to utilize your host's CRON
          scheduling, i.e. your host's ability to run specific commands on his
          server, on a predefined schedule. This would mean that your backup
          is fully automated; you sleep at night, your site backs up
          itself.</para>

          <para>Overall, the Amazon S3 upload was our first, successful
          experiment in adding affordable, enterprise-grade qualities to full
          a site backup solution. Even though that's years ahead of the
          competition, we do not settle with it. <application>Akeeba
          Backup</application> has always been in very active development. Our
          desire to push the envelope is a core ingredient of the philosophy
          behind the software. As a result, S3 - and DropBox - was just the
          beginning. Our roadmap includes support for several options of
          taking the backup off your server. We will try to integrate
          practically all major storage facilities, as long as they have a
          publicized integration API. If you have a specific need not covered
          by our base software, just contact us. We listen carefully to the
          community feedback and we make the impossible happen. All that for a

        <para>Since you have chosen Akeeba Backup for backing your site up, it
        is obvious that you are using <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> as your
        web-based Content Management System. By using
        <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> you have embarked to the joyful
        adventure of managing a <acronym>PHP</acronym> powered website.
        Usually, this last part is gone unnoticed. The fact that you are using
        a <acronym>PHP</acronym> application is often taken for granted, but
        when it comes down to security and problem solving, this is the key
        concept of which you should have a strong grasp.</para>

        <para>This part of the documentation deals with the basic concepts of
        <acronym>PHP</acronym> website management and their implications upon
        using <application>Akeeba Backup</application>. In this part, we will
        see the intricacies of access permissions, web site users and the
        impact of various <acronym>PHP</acronym> settings on your site's
        operability and security. This is not meant to be a concise manual on
        website administration. There are plenty of web and off-line resources
        with more in-depth information on the subject, but this introduction
        will quickly get you up to speed.</para>

        <para>This document is no light reading; it is purposely sprinkled
        with a lot of tech-talk, albeit explained in layman's terms. Our
        objective was not to write a document which can be read and understood
        in a single reading. Some things you will understand by the first time
        you'll have read it. Most of it you will only get it after reading it
        again. A few shady areas will only become clear reading over again and
        referring to it every time you get stuck managing your site.</para>

      <section xml:id="why-care-of-ownership-and-permissions">
        <title>Why you need to care about ownership and permissions?</title>

        <para>Most probably your server is running on
        <trademark>Linux</trademark>, or another
        <trademark>UNIX</trademark>-derivative operating system. You might
        have read, or heard, how these operating systems are safer and more
        secure than others. This is just half the story. The real security
        power of such operating systems stems from the way they manage files
        and directories, allowing or disabling access to them depending on who
        asks for it and what he's trying to do.</para>

        <para>This management is pretty much like electricity in the Western
        world. It never gets in your way and you don't think about it, but you
        must have some basic understanding of it so as not to run the risk of
        getting toasted by it. That's how it goes with ownership and
        permissions. You might not think about them a lot, but potentials
        crackers do. If you don't manage permissions wisely, you might be
        creating a security hole on your server which can be exploited by a
        malicious cracker. Nobody wants his site cracked, right?</para>

        <para>The following chapter will analyze how your web server works
        under the hood, so that you can grasp the third chapter, which
        analyzes all the ways you can secure your backup files so as not to
        fall prey on a cracker.</para>

        <title>Users and groups</title>

        <para>The concept of users is the fundamental block of ownership
        separation on multiuser operating systems. All
        <trademark>Windows</trademark> versions based on the NT kernel are
        such; <trademark>Windows</trademark> NT, 2000, XP, Vista are all
        multiuser operating systems. Other UNIX variants are also inherently
        multiuser, including <trademark>Linux</trademark> ,
        <trademark>BSD</trademark> flavours, <trademark>MacOSX</trademark> ,
        etc. Since most web servers capable of running
        <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> are based on
        <trademark>Linux</trademark> , we will talk about the
        <trademark>Linux</trademark> user system, which is in fact the same as
        the UNIX user system; after all, GNU/Linux is nothing but an
        open-source UNIX variant which became very popular among geeks and
        recently among other people, too.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="web-server-users">
          <title>Users</title>

          <para>As we mentioned, the fundamental block of ownership separation
          is a <firstterm>user</firstterm> . Each user has an entry in the
          system's password database and consists of a <firstterm>user
          name</firstterm> and a numeric <firstterm>user ID</firstterm> . A
          user is not necessarily linked to a physical person; in fact, most
          utilities and services create and operate under a user of their
          own.</para>

          <para>The numeric user ID is an unsigned integer, therefore it can
          take a value between 0 and 65534. The user name and the numeric user
          ID are usually linked with an one to one relationship, meaning that
          if you know either one you can find the other one. The exception to
          this is most ISPs. In this case, because there are more users than
          the available number of user IDs, some numeric IDs will be reused,
          breaking the one to one relationship. However, on most - if not all
          - hosts, the one to one relationship exists.</para>

          <para>Some user IDs are special. By convention, user IDs below 500
          are reserved for system users. These are special users which are not
          assigned to some physical person. One of them, zero (0), has a very
          special meaning; it is assigned to the <firstterm>super
          user</firstterm> , commonly called <firstterm>root</firstterm> .
          This user is the God of the system. He has unlimited powers. He can
          override all access restrictions and make any kind of modification.
          For this reason, no sane system administrator logs in under that
          user. They will always log in under a normal user and only
          temporarily log in as root whenever they need to change system-wide
          settings.</para>
        </sect2>

        <sect2 xml:id="web-server-groups">
          <title>Groups</title>

          <para>Defining permissions per user is tiresome on systems which
          have more than a few users. In order to combat this inconvenience,
          all UNIX systems have the notion of <firstterm>groups</firstterm> .
          A group is nothing but a collection of users. The relationship to
          users is a many-to-many relationship, meaning that one user can
          belong to many groups and one group can contain many users. To keep
          things dead simple, groups have the same format as users. Each group
          has a <firstterm>group name</firstterm> and a numeric
          <firstterm>group ID</firstterm> . Again, not all groups are linked
          to a physical person; in fact there are a number of de facto group
          names used to control access to crucial system resources.</para>

          <para>The numeric group ID is an unsigned integer, therefore it can
          take a value between 0 and 65534. The group name and group ID are
          linked with an one to one relationship, meaning that if you know
          either one you can find the other one. I am not aware of exceptions
          to this rule and I can't think a reason, either.</para>

          <para>There are some special group ID's. By convention, zero (0), is
          assigned to the root's group. Its sole member should be root, or
          other users with a user ID of 0. It empowers its members to do
          anything they please on the system, almost like the user ID 0 does.
          Noticed the "almost" part? Belonging to the root group alone,
          without having a user ID of 0, does not give you infinite powers but
          it <emphasis>does</emphasis> grant you very broad access
          indeed!</para>

          <para>Every user can belong to many different groups. To simplify
          things a little bit, every user has a so-called default group. This
          means that one of the groups he is a member of will be his effective
          group, unless otherwise specified, in all operations.</para>
        </sect2>

        <sect2 xml:id="web-server-users-and-groups-unix">
          <title>How users and groups are understood by UNIX-derived
          systems</title>

          <para>This section is a bit ahead of the rest of this chapter, I
          know that. The information contained here, though, clarify a lot of
          what will follow, so it seemed only appropriate to include it
          here.</para>

          <para>Every time the system has to store the owning user and group
          of a system item, it does so by storing the numeric user and group
          IDs, not the names! The names are only used as a convenience; you
          can't remember that John's user ID is 637, but it's easy to remember
          that his user name is john. Likewise, remembering that group ID 22
          controls access to the CD-ROM drive is improbable, while remembering
          that the group named cdrom does that is self-understood.</para>

          <important>
            <para>User IDs for a user with the same user name on different
            systems can be different. A user named example on system A and
            system B might have one user ID on system A and a completely
            different on system B. However, all UNIX-derived systems really
            know about are IDs, not names!</para>
          </important>

          <para>This is very (read: extremely) important when you transfer
          files from one system to another. All archive types which store
          owner information (for example <acronym>GNU</acronym>
          <systemitem>tar</systemitem> ) store nothing but the numeric ID's.
          Moving these to another system and extracting them will screw up
          ownership and permissions. Just because you have the user ID 567 on
          Host A doesn't mean that you won't end up with user ID 678 on Host
          B; extracting such an archive would make all your files owned by
          someone else, effectively screwing up your site.</para>

      <sect1 xml:id="web-server-ownership">
        <title>Ownership</title>

        <para>The term <firstterm>ownership</firstterm> implies that system
        items belong to someone. In the context of web site management the
        items we are interested in are files and
        <firstterm>processes</firstterm> . Everybody understands what files
        are, but the term <emphasis>processes</emphasis> is rarely understood
        amongst webmasters. So, let's explain it.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="web-server-ownership-process">
          <title>Process ownership</title>

          <para>Every time you run a program, be it interactive or a system
          service, you create a process. A process is a piece of code being
          executed by the operating system. A process can
          <firstterm>spawn</firstterm> child processes which can spawn new
          <firstterm>threads</firstterm> . In layman's terms, a program can
          start other instances of itself or another program and they, in
          turn, can start small pieces of executable code which can run in
          parallel with the main program.</para>

          <para>Programs do not start spontaneously. Someone has either got to
          start them, or instruct the system to start them when some criteria
          are met. This sentence is the acknowledgement of the simplicity
          behind a computer system; it can't think on its own, humans have to
          tell it what to do one way or the other. Based on how a program
          starts, it process will be owned by some user.</para>

          <para>In the first and simplest case, when you start a program, the
          ownership is almost self-understood. You are logged in as some user,
          so the process of the program you have executed is owned by your
          user. It's simple as that. This also implies that the process has
          the same permissions as the owning user, that's why we say that the
          process runs <emphasis>under</emphasis> this user; its access level
          is at most as much as the owning user, so the process is
          <emphasis>under</emphasis> the user.</para>

          <para>The other case, instructing the system to start a process, is
          somewhat different. Usually, the utilities which are used to start
          programs automatically are the system initialisation scripts,
          time-based execution programs (for example,
          <systemitem>cron</systemitem> and <systemitem>at</systemitem> ),
          etc. All of these programs are in most cases owned by root and are
          executed under root privileges. On top of that, most programs
          started this way are system services, running as long as the system
          is up and running. But do you remember what we said before? Root is
          the God of the system. Normally, these programs would get root's
          privileges, posing a huge security hole. If there is a bug in the
          program and some malicious user exploits it, he could wreck havoc on
          the system; root is above all restrictions.</para>

          <para>In order to combat this possibility, UNIX systems employ a
          feature which allows processes to <firstterm>drop
          privileges</firstterm> and run under a different user than the one
          which started them. In fact, they change their ownership! To prevent
          abuse of this feature, a process must run under root privileges to
          be able to switch to another user. This feature is extensively used
          by system services, including MySQL and Apache.</para>

          <para>In the context of web site management, Apache is of special
          interest. Apache is the de facto web server for Linux systems and is
          being used by over 50% of Internet sites, according to NetCraft's
          August 2008 survey. Chances are you are using it on your site, too.
          Apache, like most UNIX services (affectionately called
          <firstterm>daemons</firstterm>) uses the feature to drop privileges.
          The user and group under which it runs are defined in its
          configuration files. These configuration files are usually out of
          the reach of regular users (like you!) on commercial hosts, for
          security reasons.</para>

          <para>There is a <emphasis role="bold">special case</emphasis> which
          acts as the exception to the Apache rule. Many commercial hosts run
          <emphasis role="bold">suPHP</emphasis>-enabled Apache installations.
          This is an extension to the normal PHP's mode of operation which
          allows each PHP page to run in a process owned by the file's owner
          (more on file ownership in the next sub-section). This means that
          each of the PHP files under your account on such a host run as the
          user which has been assigned to your account. And, if this still
          isn't apparent to you, such hosts nullify the burden of ownership
          and permissions (more on permissions in the next section). To put it
          clearly: with suPHP the file owner, your own user and the Apache
          user are one and the same. If you are looking for a decent host,
          find one which is using suPHP. It's better for security and removes
          a lot of administrative burden from you. A win-win situation.</para>

          <title>File ownership</title>

          <para>Everybody knows what a file is, right? Well, we all know
          intuitively what a file <emphasis>might</emphasis> be, but we seldom
          know what <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> it is. A file is actually
          consisted of at least two parts. The first part is the file data,
          what we intuitively understand as the file contents. The second part
          is the file system entry, which makes the file data an identifiable
          entity. This is where the operating system stores all kinds of
          information, such as how the file is named, where it is located in
          the file system hierarchy, when it was modified, etc. It also
          contains information about who owns the files and what are the
          file's permissions. You might be surprised reading this, but only
          this latter, informative, part is required for a file.
          Really!</para>

          <para>It seems absurd to have a file without file data, but it is
          anything but that. There are some special "files" (more correctly:
          file system entries) in the UNIX world. You have devices, whose
          "files" actually point to a serial input/output provided by this
          device, for example the serial port of your computer. There are
          directories, which obviously don't have any data contained; they are
          used for organising files only. There are soft links, which are
          pointers to other files in the file system, used to have
          standardised names and locations on files which might be moved
          around or have varying names. There are also these wired beasts
          called "hard links", some peculiar file system entries which point
          to the file data of another file, making virtually impossible to
          know which is the "original" file and which is its clone. Their
          usefulness is only apparent to the UNIX gurus, therefore out of the
          scope of this document. For the purpose of website management we are
          only concerned about regular files (hereby called "files"),
          directories and soft links (hereby called "links").</para>

          <para>All files, directories and links are owned by a user and a
          group, be they files or links. In fact, they are owned by a user ID
          and a group ID. Normally, the ownership is inherited by the creating
          process's ownership. When you create a file directly from an
          interactive editor application the editor's process is owned by your
          user ID and your default group ID, therefore the file will be owned
          by your user ID and your default group ID.</para>

          <para>Links are a special case on their own. They are not files,
          they are pointer to files. The ownership (and permissions) of links
          is irrelevant. Whenever a process tries to access a link, the
          underlying operating system "follows" the link, until it finds a
          regular file. Therefore, the ownership that matters is that of the
          file linked to, not the link itself. This feature of the operating
          system prevents unauthorised access to arbitrary files, normally
          accessible to specific users only, from users who just happen to
          know the path to those files.</para>

          <para>What is especially interesting is the correlation between FTP,
          web server and file ownership. Whenever you access FTP, you log in
          as some user. This user is linked to a system user (often the same
          user assigned to you by host), so logging in FTP actually has the
          same effect as logging into the system as this user. Common sense
          implies that all file operations are performed under this user and
          all files created (read: uploaded) through FTP will be owned by this
          user.</para>

          <para>Conversely, whenever you are using a web interface to perform
          file operations, you are using a web application - or any PHP
          script/application for that matter - running on the web server whose
          process is owned by a different user. Therefore, whenever you create
          files from a web application, they will be owned by the user the web
          server runs under.</para>

          <para>The distinction of file ownership in these two cases is of
          paramount importance when you get stuck with files which are
          accessible to FTP but inaccessible to the web server, or vice versa.
          This minute distinction is the cause of a lot of grief to many
          webmasters, so beware!</para>

        <title>Permissions</title>

        <para>So far you have learned about users, groups and ownerships. But
        how do they all stick together? Why these are necessary to have in the
        first place? The reason is simple: security. In multiuser operating
        systems you normally don't like users snooping around other people's
        files, especially when those files contain sensitive information, such
        as passwords. The most common method for overcoming this problem is to
        assign <firstterm>permissions</firstterm> on each system item,
        controlling who can do what. This simple concept works wonderfully;
        it's like putting doors on a building and giving people only the keys
        for the doors to areas they should have access to.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="web-server-permissions-types">
          <title>The three types of permissions</title>

          <para>We already learned that each system item is owned by a user ID
          and a group ID. Whenever a process tries to access a system item,
          the operating system checks the permissions and decides if it will
          proceed with the operation or deny access. It seems reasonable to
          have control over what a process with the same owning user ID can do
          with it, what the a process with the same owning group ID can do
          with it and, finally, what the rest of the world can do with it.
          Indeed, this is the rationale behind the three types of permissions
          we can define on UNIX systems. In order of precedence they
          are:</para>

              <term>User permissions</term>

                <para>They are the access rights granted to the owning user of
                the item. Every process with the same owning user ID as the
                item's owning user ID has these access rights. These access
                rights have precedence over all other permissions.</para>

                of the item. Every process with the same owning group ID as
                the item's owning group ID has these access rights. These
                access rights are applied only if the owning user ID's of the
                process and the item do not match, but their owning group ID's

          <title>What permissions can control</title>

          <para>We will be focused on permissions on files and directories,
          the building blocks of a web site. Permissions can control only
          three different actions:</para>

              <term>Read</term>

              <listitem>

                <para>The ability to write to a file, or the ability to
                create, rename and delete files and subdirectories on a

              <listitem>
                <para>For files, it controls the ability to be directly
                executable from the command line. It is only meaningful for
                binary programs and executable scripts. For directories, it
                controls the ability to change to that directory. Note that if
                this is disabled you can't usually obtain a directory listing

          <para>These three actions, combined with the three access request
          groups (owning user, owning group and the rest of the world) give us
          a total of nine distinct operations which can be controlled. Each
          action is an on/off switch. If a permission is set, it is turned on
          and the right to perform the action is granted. If the permission is

          <title>Permissions notation</title>

          <para>The two most common notations for permissions is the
          <firstterm>textual notation</firstterm> and the <firstterm>octal
          notation</firstterm>. Each one has its own virtues.</para>

          <sect3>
            <title>The textual notation</title>

            <para>The textual notation is traditionally used in UNIX long
            directory listing format and in most FTP clients listings as well.
            It consists of ten characters. The first one displays the file
            type. It can be one of dash (regular file), "d" (a directory) or
            "l" (a link). The following nine characters display the
            permissions, consisting of three groups of three letters each. The
            groups are in order of appearance: owning user, owning group and
            others. The permissions on each group are in order of appearance:
            read (denoted with r), write (denoted with w) and execute/browse
            (denoted with x). If a permission is not set, a dash appears
            instead of the letter.</para>

            <para>For example, the string
            <computeroutput>-rwxr-xr-x</computeroutput> means that it is a
            regular file, the owning user has read/write/execute permissions,
            the owning group has read and execute permissions and so does the
            rest of the world. On the other hand, the string
            <computeroutput>dr-x------</computeroutput> indicates that we have
            a directory whose owning user has read and browse permissions and
            everybody else (owning group and the rest of the world) have no
            right to access it.</para>
          </sect3>

          <sect3>
            <title>The octal notation</title>

            <para>This is the de facto standard geeks use to communicate
            permissions. The benefit of this approach is that you only need
            four characters to fully define them and they're easier to read
            (to the trained eye, at least).</para>

            <para>Permissions are in fact a bit field. Each permission is a
            bit which can be turned on or off. If you put bits together they
            form bytes (by grouping eight bits together). Many bytes one next
            to the other form a computer-readable representation of a whole
            number (an integer). If you write this down in base 8, you've got
            the octal representation. If you didn't understand this, it's OK.
            We'll explain it the easy way.</para>

            <para>The octal notation consists of four numbers. In the context
            of web site management you can consider the first to be always
            zero and sometimes omitted. The next three numbers describe each
            one the permissions. The second number describes owning user
            permissions. The third number describes owning group's
            permissions. The fourth number describes the permissions for the
            rest of the world. Each number is 0 to 7. The meaning of each
            number is simple:</para>

            <para>It is almost apparent that "1" stands for execute only, "2"
            stands for write only and "4" stands for read only. Adding these
            values together gives you the rest of the combinations. You can't
            add together the same value (1+1 is forbidden as it is
            meaningless), so each of the composite values can be broken down
            to its components very easily. You don't even have to memorise the
            whole table!</para>

            <para>A permission of 0777 means that the owning user, owning
            group and the rest of the world can read, write and execute the
            file (full permissions for everyone). A 0764 permission means that
            the owning user has full access, the owning group has read and
            write access and the rest of the world have read only
            access.</para>

      <title>Securing your Akeeba Backup installation</title>

      <section xml:id="access-rights">
        <title>Access rights</title>

        <para>As with every software which can access your site as a whole,
        <application>Akeeba Backup</application> needs to control who's got
        access to its backup functionality. Due to the lack of a thorough ACL
        mechanism in Joomla! 1.0 and 1.5, we have decided to make the
        administrator (back end) of this component available by default to the
        Super Administrators only. This group of people already has infinite
        access to the access, making them the ideal candidate for backup
        operators. You can change this default behavior from the component's
        Parameters button in the Control Panel page.</para>

        <para>The front-end backup feature is a different story. Since it has
        to be available to unattended scripts which can't use cookies and
        interactive user authentication, a different approach was taken.
        Instead of requiring the user to have logged in with Joomla! it uses a
        simple "secret word" authentication model. Because this "secret word"
        is transmitted in clear text we strongly advise against using it over
        anything else than a local network (for example, an automated tool
        running on the same host as the web server). If you have to use it
        over the Internet we strongly advise using a secure protocol
        connection (HTTPS) with a valid commercially acquired
        certificate.</para>

        <para>If you want to enhance the security of your site, we strongly
        advise you to use a commercial-grade ACL system, such as Dioscouri's
        JUGA or `CorePHP` Community ACL on top of <application>Akeeba
        Backup</application>'s rudimentary access control and Joomla! 1.6's
        ACL system. Such ACL systems allow you to fine-tune the permission
        settings down to the user and component view level, if so required.
        Using such an ACL scheme you can create, for example, a backup
        operator user who has access to the Backup Now and configuration pages
        of <application>Akeeba Backup</application>, but not the Download
        function.</para>

      <section xml:id="securing-temp-output-directories">
        <title>Securing the output directory</title>

        <bridgehead>Securing the backup output directory</bridgehead>

        <para>By default the component uses a non secure location to store its
        backup files and temporary files, within your site's file system
        hierarchy, namely
        <filename>administrator/components/com_akeeba/backup</filename>. This
        location is well known and can be - theoretically - accessed directly
        from a web browser. Since the backup output directory stores the
        results of your backup attempts, that is SQL files containing database
        backups and archive files containing all of your site, a malicious
        person with access to this location could steal sensitive information
        or compromise your site's integrity.</para>

        <para>The first line of defense, is to use mangled, hard to guess,
        names for the SQL backup. However, in the era of multi-MbPS xDSL
        Internet connections and scripting, it wouldn't take an attacker that
        long to figure out the filename. Remember: security through obscurity
        is no security at all!</para>

        <para>As a second line of defense, we include a secure
        <filename>.htaccess</filename> on the default backup output directory
        to disable direct web access. However, this is only possible on
        Apache-powered web servers which allow the use of
        <filename>.htaccess</filename> files. You should check with your host
        to ensure that this kind of protection is possible on your
        site.</para>

        <para>However, this is not enough. Security experts argue that storing
        backups within the potentially vulnerable system itself might be a
        security risk. It is possible that a malicious person could gain
        access via other means. Think of a simple scenario. You have an
        Administrator with a weak password a hacker eventually guesses. Now
        the hacker can log in to your site, but doesn't have access to the
        component. Despite that, you have installed a file administration
        component, such as eXtplorer, which allows administrators to browse
        the site's file system and download files. How long would it take
        before your site got compromised? Right. Not very long indeed!</para>

        <para>The best approach is to use a directory which is outside your
        web server's root. By definition, this is not directly exposed to the
        web and is usually unavailable to file administration
        utilities.</para>

        <para>If you are really paranoid about securing your site's backup
        files - like we are for our own sites! - you can use Akeeba Remote
        Control. Remote Control is a desktop application for Microsoft
        <trademark>Windows</trademark> which allows backing up your site from
        your desktop, with options to automatically downloading the backup
        archive and remove the server's copy of this file. Alternatively, you
        can use our backup file post-processing options, for example uploading
        all backup archives to Amazon S3 and removing your server copy.</para>

        <title>Securing file transfers</title>

        <para>Whenever you download your backup files you can fall prey to a
        malicious user. Backup files are transferred unencrypted (unless you
        access your site's administrator section through the HTTPS protocol).
        It is possible for a resourceful hacker to launch a man-in-the-middle
        attack. In such a case, whatever you download from your site will be
        directed to the hacker's computer before reaching yours.</para>

        <para>To avoid such insecure scenarios, we advise against using the
        <guibutton>Download</guibutton> button in the backup administration
        page. We suggest that you use Secure FTP (SFTP) instead. Avoid using
        the plain old FTP, because your password and data are transmitted in
        clear text (unencrypted) over the Internet. Also avoid FTPS and FTPES
        (FTP over SSL) as they have some security restrictions, like requiring
        your FTP server to have a commercially obtained SSL certificate in
        order to be really effective. Sometimes, your host will allow secure
        access to a web based control panel which has a file download feature.
        You could use this, it's as safe as it gets.</para>

        <para>There is also another reason why not to use the
        <guibutton>Download</guibutton> button in the backup administration
        page. Your host neither discriminates the back end and front end pages
        of your Joomla! site, nor your IP from the rest of the world. As a
        result, every time you use the <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> back
        end, the data transferred counts towards your monthly bandwidth quota.
        Backup archives are large, sometimes in the hundreds of megabytes.
        Transferring them through the Download feature will incur a huge loss
        on your monthly bandwidth quota. Using Secure FTP or your host's
        control panel <emphasis>usually</emphasis> does not count through the
        bandwidth quota and should be used instead. It's better to ask your
        host, though; some include the FTP and SFTP traffic in your monthly
        bandwidth quota. Finally, the Download feature doesn't work with all
        possible configurations and has objective problems with the handling
        of very large archives; this is a technical limitation which can not
        be overcome in the PHP level the component operates. Most notably,
        many servers which use the FastCGI mode do not work at all with the
        <guibutton>Download</guibutton> button. They will simply throw an HTTP
        500 error page, or a "file not found" message. We've tried all the
        tricks in the book and then some more, but there's really absolutely
        nothing we can do about it. Sorry.</para>

        <important>
          <para>The preferred and suggested method for downloading your backup
          files - for several reasons - is using FTP in BINARY mode,
          preferably over an encrypted connection. Alternatively, you can use
          Remote CLI which allows you to use this approach when downloading
          backup archives.</para>

      <title>The JPA archive format, v.1.2</title>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">Design goals</bridgehead>

      <para>The JPA format strives to be a compressed archive format designed
      specifically for efficiency of creation by a PHP script. It is similar
      in design to the PKZIP format, with a few notable differences:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>CRC32 is not used; calculation of file checksums is time
          consuming and can lead to errors when attempted on large files from
          a script running under PHP4, or a script running on PHP5 without the
          hash extension.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Only allowed compression methods are store and deflate.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>There is no Central Directory (simplifies management of the
          file).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>File permissions (UNIX style) are stored within the
          file.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Even though JPA is designed for use by PHP scripts, creating a
      command-line utility, a programming library or even a GUI program in any
      other language is still possible. JPA is not supposed to have high
      compression rations, or be secure and error-tolerant as other archive
      formats. It merely an attempt to provide the best compromise for
      creating archives of very large directory trees using nothing but PHP
      code to do it.</para>

      <para>This is an open format. You may use it in any commercial or
      non-commercial application royalty-free. Even though the PHP
      implementation is GPL-licensed, we can provide it under
      commercial-friendly licenses, e.g. LGPL v3. Please ask us if you want to
      use it on your own software.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">Structure of an archive</bridgehead>

      <para>An archive consists of exactly one <token>Standard Header</token>
      and one or more <token>Entity Blocks</token> . Each <token>Entity
      Block</token> consists of exactly one <token>Entity Description
      Block</token> and at most one <token>File Data Block</token> . All
      values are stored in little-endian byte order, unless otherwise
      specified.</para>

      <para>All textual data, e.g. file names and symlink targets, must be
      written as little-endian UTF-8, non null terminated strings, for the
      widest compatibility possible.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">Standard Header</bridgehead>

      <para>The function of the Standard Header is to allow identification of
      the archive format and supply the client with general information
      regarding the archive at hand. It is a binary block appearing at the
      beginning of the archive file and there alone. It consists of the
      following data (in order of appearance):</para>

      <variablelist>

          <listitem>
            <para>Unsigned short integer represented as two bytes, holding the
            size of the header in bytes. This is now fixed to 19 bytes, but
            this variable is here to allow for forward compatibility. When
            extra header fields are present, this value will be 19 + the
            length of all extra fields.</para>

      .j02 and so on. The last file of the archive set has the extension
      .jpa.</para>

      <para>When creating spanned archives you must ensure that the Entity
      Description Block is within the limits of a single part, i.e. the

      The File Data Block data can cross one or multiple part blocks.</para>

      Block is merely the aggregation of an Entity Description Block and at
      most one File Data Block. An Entity can be at present either a File or a

      Directory the File Data Block is omitted. In any other case, the File
      Data Block must exist.</para>

      <para><bridgehead renderas="sect2">Entity Description Block
      </bridgehead> The function of the Entity Description Block is to provide
      the client information about an Entity included in the archive. The
      client can then use this information in order to reconstruct a copy of
      the Entity on the client's file system. It is a binary block consisting
      of the following data (in order of appearance):</para>

      <title>The JPS archive format, v.1.9</title>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">Design goals</bridgehead>

      <para>The JPS format strives to be a compressed archive format designed
      specifically for efficiency of creation by a PHP script, while providing
      secure AES-128 encryption of the file descriptor and file contents. It
      is similar in design to the JPA, with a few notable differences:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Both the file descriptor and the file data are split to 64Kb
          blocks encrypted using AES-128 in CBC mode</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>All files are compressed using Deflate (ZLib)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Even though JPS is designed for use by PHP scripts, creating a
      command-line utility, a programming library or even a GUI program in any
      other language is still possible. JPS is supposed to have low to medium
      compression rations, and be secure. However it is not as error-tolerant
      as other archive formats.</para>

      <para>This is an open format. You may use it in any commercial or
      non-commercial application royalty-free. Even though the PHP
      implementation is GPL-licensed, we can provide it under
      commercial-friendly licenses, e.g. LGPL v3. Please ask us if you want to
      use it on your own software.</para>

      <important>
        <para>When the password is blank, no encryption takes place. Archivers
        should take this into account when creating files. Unarchivers should
        also take this into account when the user passes an empty string as
        their password.</para>

        <para>When a non-blank password is used, all files are encrypted using
        the same password. More specifically, all data blocks are encrypted
        using the same password.</para>
      </important>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">Structure of an archive</bridgehead>

      <para>An archive consists of exactly one <token>Standard Header</token>
      and one or more <token>Entity Blocks</token> . Each <token>Entity
      Block</token> consists of exactly one <token>Entity Description
      Block</token> and at most one <token>File Data Block</token>. Each FIle
      Data Block consist of one or several <token>Data Chunk Blocks</token>.
      All values are stored in little-endian byte order, unless otherwise
      specified.</para>

      <para>All textual data, e.g. file names and symlink targets, must be
      written as little-endian UTF-8, non null terminated strings, for the
      widest compatibility possible.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">Standard Header</bridgehead>

      <para>The function of the Standard Header is to allow identification of
      the archive format and supply the client with general information
      regarding the archive at hand. It is a binary block appearing at the
      beginning of the archive file and there alone. It consists of the
      following data (in order of appearance):</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Signature, 3 bytes</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>The bytes 0x4A 0x50 0x54 (uppercase ASCII string “JPS”) used

          <term>Minor version, 1 byte</term>

          <listitem>

          <term>Extra header length, 2 bytes</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>The total length of extra headers. In version 1.9 of the
            format it is always 0.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>The total size of this header is 8 bytes, plus the size of the
      extra headers (if any).</para>

      <para><bridgehead renderas="sect1">Entity Block</bridgehead>An Entity
      Block is merely the aggregation of exactly one Entity Description Block,
      followed by the encrypted contents of exactly one Entity Description
      Block Data and zero or one instances of a File Data Block. An Entity can
      be at present a File, Symbolic Link or Directory. If the entity is a
      File of zero length or if it is a Directory the File Data Block is
      omitted. In any other case, the File Data Block must exist.</para>

      <para><bridgehead renderas="sect2">Entity Description Block

      <para>In split archives, the first 8 bytes must appear within the same

      Block Data. The Encrypted Data can span multiple parts. Since the
      minimum part size is 64Kb and the maximum Decrypted Size can't be over
      64Kb, the Encrypted Data will either be in the same part in its

      You must also ensure that the Entity Description Block is within the
      limits of a single part, i.e. the contents of the Entity Description
      Block must not cross part boundaries. The File Data Block data can cross
      one or multiple part blocks, but the header of each Data Chunk Block
      must both be inside the same part.</para>

      <para>This header is written after the end of the archive data, at the
      end of the last part of the archive. Its structure is:</para>

      Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
      Sections then there are none.</para>

      <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
      listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
      says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover
      Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25
      words.</para>

      <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
      general public, that is suitable for revising the document
      straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
      pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
      drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
      automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
      markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage
      subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format
      is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy
      that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</para>

      <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
      ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
      XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
      PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of
      transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats
      include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
      proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
      processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
      HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
      purposes only.</para>

      <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
      plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
      this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
      which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
      near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
      beginning of the body of the text.</para>

      <para>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
      whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
      following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands
      for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
      "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of
      such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
      section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</para>

      <para>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
      which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
      Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
      but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
      these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
      meaning of this License.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">2. VERBATIM COPYING</bridgehead>

      <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
      commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
      the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
      conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
      technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
      of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
      compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
      number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section
      3.</para>

      <para>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
      and you may publicly display copies.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</bridgehead>

      <para>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
      have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
      Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
      copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
      Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
      cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
      publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
      with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
      other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited
      to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
      satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
      respects.</para>

      <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
      pages.</para>

      <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
      numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
      Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
      Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
      network-using public has access to download using public-standard
      network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of
      added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably
      prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity,
      to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the
      stated location until at least one year after the last time you
      distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers)
      of that edition to the public.</para>

      <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
      the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
      give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
      Document.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">4. MODIFICATIONS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
      under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
      release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
      Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
      distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
      possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the
      Modified Version:</para>

      <orderedlist numeration="upperalpha">
        <listitem>
          <simpara>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History
          section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous
          version if the original publisher of that version gives
          permission.</simpara>

          Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title
          Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document,
          create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
          Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the
          Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.</simpara>

          <simpara>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the
          Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document,
          and likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the
          "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that
          was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if
          the original publisher of the version it refers to gives
          permission.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</simpara>

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section

        <listitem>
          <simpara>Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</simpara>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
      appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
      copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
      of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list
      of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These
      titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</para>

      <para>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
      contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
      parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
      been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
      standard.</para>

      <para>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
      and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
      list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
      Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
      arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a
      cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement
      made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
      another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from
      the previous publisher that added the old one.</para>

      <para>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
      License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
      assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may combine the Document with other documents released under
      this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
      versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
      Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
      list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license
      notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</para>

      <para>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
      multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
      copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
      different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding
      at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or
      publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the
      same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections
      in the license notice of the combined work.</para>

      <para>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
      "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
      Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
      "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must
      delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</bridgehead>

      <para>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
      documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies
      of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is
      included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this
      License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
      respects.</para>

      <para>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
      distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
      copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
      License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
      document.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT
      WORKS</bridgehead>

      <para>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
      separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
      storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
      copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal
      rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works
      permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does
      not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
      derivative works of the Document.</para>

      <para>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
      copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
      the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers
      that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic
      equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise
      they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
      aggregate.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">8. TRANSLATION</bridgehead>

      <para>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
      distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
      Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
      permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
      translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
      original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
      translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
      Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
      the original English version of this License and the original versions
      of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the
      translation and the original version of this License or a notice or
      disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</para>

      <para>If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
      "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its
      Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
      title.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">9. TERMINATION</bridgehead>

      <para>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
      except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
      to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
      automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
      who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
      not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
      full compliance.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS
      LICENSE</bridgehead>

      <para>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
      the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
      will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
      detail to address new problems or concerns. See <link
      xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/"
      xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
      http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</link> .</para>

      <para>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
      number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of
      this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option
      of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version
      or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
      Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
      number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
      as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect1">ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your
      documents</bridgehead>

      <para>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy
      of the License in the document and put the following copyright and
      license notices just after the title page:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>Copyright (C) YEAR YOUR NAME.</para>

        <para>Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
        document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
        Version 1.2 or any later version published by the Free Software
        Foundation; with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no
        Back-Cover Texts. A copy of the license is included in the section
        entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
      Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:</para>

      <blockquote>
        <para>with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
        Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being
        LIST.</para>
      </blockquote>

      <para>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
      combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
      situation.</para>

      <para>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
      recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
      software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
      their use in free software.</para>
